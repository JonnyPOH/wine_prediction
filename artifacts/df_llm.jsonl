{"prompt":"Very good Dry Creek Zin, robust and dry and spicy. Really gets the tastebuds watering, with its tart flavors of sour cherry candy, red currants, blueberries, tart raisins and oodles of peppery spices. Drink this lusty wine with barbecue.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A very herbaceous character makes this wine seem rather thin. It's soft and lightweight, and the lemon zest character is mildly attractive. Ready to drink.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A little simple and easy, but there's a wealth of raspberry, strawberry and floral notes in this delicate wine. It's a bit too sweet for my tastes, although it does have good acidity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From a dry-farmed vineyard and treated to wild yeast and minimal new French oak, this Petite is chewy in leathery tannins, a definite crowd pleaser for Petite fans. Blackberries, coffee and pepper commingle impressively.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From a site near Annapolis, this wine shows a preponderance of dark grape and cherry flavor interwoven with cinnamon and black peppercorn. Light-bodied and ethereally layered, it has touches of rustic earthiness and leather.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Taurasi is a wine that flaunts a determined and powerful personality, and Fatica Contadina is no exception, thanks to its deep layers of spice, dark fruit, tobacco and cigar that it delivers to the senses. On the palate, it is austere and tightly structured.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Sourced entirely from Walla Walla's Les Collines Vineyard, this lovely Syrah features pretty strawberry and cherry flavors that are broadly displayed with a rich vein of chocolate. It's forward and flavorful, drinking quite nicely already, but with the stuffing to cellar for a few more years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"There's a lot to like about this Viognier. It's dry and zesty in acidity, with complex flavors of citrus, peach, kumquat, white pepper, chamomile and honey.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc, fermented and aged in stainless steel. Shows rich, savory citrus and green grass flavors, with hints of minerals and flowers. Very drinkable and bone-dry.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This proprietary bottling from Shafer is always a huge wine. The 2010, which contains a splash of Petite Verdot, is gigantically packed with blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak, courtesy of 20 months in 100% new French oak barrels. The wine is a bit of a bully now, but it has the balance to age. Give it until 2018.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made with organically farmed fruit, this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Colorino opens with an inky, dark color and savory aromas of ripe fruit, prune, plum, leather, tobacco and exotic spice. It's firm and well structured, with a velvety feel to the tannins.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of blue flower, black-skinned fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub meld in the glass. The chewy, straightforward palate doles out juicy black cherry and ground pepper. It's made to drink young so enjoy soon.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Bright, clean and linear with pretty accents of spice, blackberry, leather and lingering tobacco, Villa al Cortile Riserva is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with a hearty meat dinner. The wine shows velvety, soft texture in the mouth.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, the grapes are single vineyard, Rattlesnake Hills AVA fruit. The best of the Girly Girl lineup, though the promising beginning (cassis and berry, scented with black olive and herb) quickly fades into a forest floor finale of decaying leaves.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The 2009 vintage blend is 41% Marsanne, 42% Grenache Blanc, 10% Picpoul and 7% Roussanne. Complex, rich and dense, it wraps its stone and tropical fruit flavors in layers of caramel, nougat, marshmallow and spice. Still quite young, with plenty of years of life ahead.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, Campobello's entry-level red is slightly muddled, but it does a good job of offering genuine fruit flavors and overall freshness.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This unusual wine displays notes of cigar box, strong green herbs and woodspice. It drinks on the lighter side of medium bodied with coffee and nori flavors and a smoke-filled finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A bit rough in texture, but otherwise pretty flavorful, with vanilla, lime, strawberry and yeast flavors. It's a great sparkling wine for everyday.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"It's not a bad name for this vineyard\u2014Charmes. This wine, which expresses the nature of the vineyard, is certainly approachable, friendly almost. But there's also a steel fist there that demands time. And if you can't wait, it's a great wine to drink now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Like a photocopy of a photocopy, this thinned-down Pinot Noir contains only a suggestion of the real thing. It's dry, but watery in cherry-cola flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Spicy and dry, this Zin offers flavors of currants, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. The tannins are thick, but acidity is low, giving it a soft mouthfeel. Could be more concentrated, but it's an elegant wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fresh ripe raspberry aromas are cut with cranberry-skin tartness in this wine by Josh Baker and Matt Brain. They have also managed to sneak blood, pencil shavings, eucalyptus and vanilla stick into the nose of this appellation blend. It's lively and tasty with ripe, tart red fruits once sipped, juicy yet cut with chaparral scrub elements.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4\u20136 years and see where it goes.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Powerful and intense without going over the top, this is a fine example of white Hermitage. The golden straw color gives a first indication of its richness, followed by scents of honey, even a hint of butterscotch. It's unctuous in the mouth, boasting flavors of grilled nuts and stone fruits, and finishing with just a touch of warmth.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Dry as a bone, with bristling minerality, this is an elegant ros\u00e9 that balances penetrating strawberry, cherry and plum flavors with sharp, lime-tinged acidity and a hint of wildflower. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"One of the first 2008 Pinots to be released, this fresh young wine has Beaujolais Nouveau-like flavors of freshly crushed cherries, with tangy acidity. It's a fun wine to drink with a juicy cheeseburger.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A very good introduction to Steven Kent's Livermore Cabernets, sourced from a handful of his single-vineyard designates, including the Ghielmetti, Home Ranch and Smith Ranch. This is 79% Cab with smatterings of Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot (an up and coming varietal in Livermore), and still needs some time to develop but all the essentials are there.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon make a warm, blend that is full, herbal and concentrated with black fruits and dark tannins. Spice provides a reminder that this wine comes from a warm climate. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2016.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This opens with a pretty floral fragrance of acacia, Spanish broom and chamomile. The palate doles out white peach and tangerine zest alongside fresh acidity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Green vegetable aromas mingle with fresh kiwi and lime and a touch of pepper and salt. The wine is going through the sort of closed-up phase common with Chenin Blanc, the fruits just a hint, the texture smooth. Give it another 3\u20134 years, and the fruits will come together with mature almond flavors.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Ripe orange, lime and honey flavors combine with tingly, mouth-watering acidity to give this dry Chardonnay a sweet-and-sour taste. It's an easy wine to drink with mushroom risotto, garlic shrimp, chicken fajitas.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This delicate Pinot Noir provides plenty of drinking pleasure, but it's not without limitations. Chief among them is a hint of raw, dank mushroom. It's not strong, but just enough to weigh down the raspberries and cherries. Drink it by 2016.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The shade of this Kathy Joseph creation is that of ros\u00e9-colored sunglasses. Such comfort is furthered with a cherry cola and maraschino cherry nose. A slight effervescent zing on the palate accompanies pomegranate flavors followed by an impressively long finish. Great with a fresh garden salad, but able to handle more substantial fare too, such as  breaded chicken cutlets or a cheeseburger.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Overt and round, with chunky aromas of berries and stone fruits. Quite lively and zesty, with purity of flavors. Is it a touch limited in scope and complexity? Yes. But the nectarine and orange flavors are crystalline and the mouthfeel rocks. Imported by Vranken America.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A pale pink sparkler with loads of intensity and elegance, Essence opens with delicate aromas of cranberry, toasted almond, mature fruit and grapefruit. The wine's perlage is steady and foamy.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Nasty. Hits the mouth with astringent green flavors and turns harsher and more bitter on the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine's excellently layered yet light nose mixes pomelo skin with tangelo and lime-spritzed pink-apple notes. The palate is extremely nervy, with grippy lemon-skin texture and squeezed-citrus flavors, all balanced by riper apple. It's like biting into a cold, crisp, just-ripe pear or nectarine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Viognier does well in warm climates and this Sicilian expression of the French grape shows pretty floral nuances backed by white almond and orange blossom. Pair this wine with sea bass grilled in lemon leaves or fried squid.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Yeasty, bready aromas of cantaloupe and citrus feed into an undefined palate that foams up on tongue. Citrus and melon flavors are bland, with powdered sugar and orange notes on the finish.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Sourced from a vineyard planted by Gary Andrus in 1998, this elegant and expressive wine is shaded a lovely rose tone, and scents of rose petals and ripe cherries emerge instantly from the glass. It's well defined, balanced and detailed with sandalwood, cocoa powder, cinnamon and orange-liqueur highlights. Drink now through 2021.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The classic blend for Figeac with its 32% of Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc gives a beautifully dense wine with great tannins. The wine is perfumed while the complex tannins are finely cushioned by the generous black fruits and acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2026.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This wine wears its 15.8% alcohol better than any similarly heady wine out there. Yes, it's a bit hot, but the heat comes across as a slight chili pepper edge to the blackberry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors, and the wine is, in its own way, balanced and elegant. Hard to imagine a more perfect barbecue red.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Like the regular Chardonnay, Beuna Vista's regular Pinot Noir is a medium-bodied, easy-drinking version of the variety. There's enough herbal complexity to keep it interesting, but the cherry-tinged fruit is ripe and the tannins supple. Finishes with a burst of crisp acidity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Similar to Petite Sirah, this is a dark, full-bodied red wine with significant tannins. It's dry, with berry, currant and spice flavors, and kind of rustic. Calls to mind barbecue.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A quite green style of Champagne, very clean and very crisp. From one of the Champagne cooperatives, this is a great value wine, with pleasing freshness. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"At first this Chaleur Estate seemed closed up tight and lightly herbal, but grudgingly opened with streaks of olive, chalk, coffee grounds. A second bottle was much brighter, layered with plum, cherry, chocolate, herb, and an impression of pepper. Subtle and sleek, this wine is built to age and needs to be decanted.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An elegant Cabernet that's ready to drink tonight and will hold for some years. Shows good Napa character, with lush, ripe tannins and flavors of black currants, blackberries and cedar that cry out for a good steak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A light, entry-level red, with fresh berry aromas and a touch of dried herbs. Dry, but with an appealing softness to its texture.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This new Malbec is a soft, fruity, extremely dark wine, with scents of raisins and pretty fruit flavors of boysenberries and black cherries, with lighter streaks of coffee and caramel woven through. The balance is excellent, though the wine does not show the depth of flavor that is expressed in its inky dark colors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Light, fresh wine, showing pineapple and pear flavors, but in a delicate way. It has lift, crispness, a fine touch of citrus and a hint of toast. An attractive, easy white Burgundy. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Dark and deep, with cola, black fruit and truffle aromas. There's good lift to the palate, but overall it has to be classified as a dense, warm-climate wine with a big body and equally large flavors of black plum, olive and coffee. Seems short and a little simple on the finish.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Light and citrusy, this off-dry Riesling features pleasant floral and spice notes that just lack a little zip on the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Stiff and tart, this young wine needs a few more years of cellaring to fill itself out. The balance is right, and the vineyard's full-bodied tannins are there in abundance.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Thin and watery, with diluted citrus flavors and lots of raw acidity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Sobra is Brazilian Portuguese for leftovers. It's a Bordeaux blend, but the recipe changes every year. This is very nice and drinking well, smooth with a nicely resolved mix of black fruits, smoky wood, pepper and a bit of bacon fat.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne-style blend meant to be drunk early and around a weekday meal, among Terre Rouge's easiest to drink and find wines. There's lots to like, from the wine's high-toned cherry and boysenberry aromas and flavors to its traces of black olive and jaunty, gamy pepper.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The simplest and fruitiest of the Cahors made at Gaudou, this is still a structured wine that has some firm, very young tannins that need to round out. Plenty of fruity, fresh black-currant flavor is cut by crisp acidity. The wine will need to age, so drink from 2016.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albari\u00f1o that won't steer you wrong.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer. The oaky flavors quickly overtake fruit that is simple, clean, and apple flavored.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made from equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this wine was aged on the lees for more than four years, which gives it a fabulous creamy, yeasty complexity. There are tantalizing flavors of limes, orange zest, roasted hazelnuts, minerals and smoke. Absolutely wonderful now, and should hold and develop in the bottle through 2014, at least. Only 563 cases produced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Nice and dry, with lots of black pepper-infused wild blackberry flavors wrapped into big but pliant tannins. Lots of crunchy acidity, too, which makes the wine sharp. Will be great with a rich steak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A monstrous mix of Mourv\u00e8dre (89%) and Syrah (11%) from Calaveras's Dalton Vineyard, Twisted Oak's River of Skulls opens with a heady nose of bright cherry, black tea and candied dark plum and shows off bright acidity for such a pleasantly plump wine. Tannins are resolved and yet rightfully there. The long finish is enveloped in raspberry flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a bright, buoyant style of Brunello that drinks easily but also delivers the sophistication and complexity you should expect of Montalcino. It opens with crisp, tonic aromas of cassis and wild berry with very subtle aromas of vanilla and toasted nut at the back.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Aged only in stainless steel to preserve its fresh, clean flavors, this expression of Favorita (a little-known white wine grape from northern Italy) offers lively tones of lemon zest, white blossom and cut grass.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"High in acidity and ripe in pineapple and vanilla flavors, this is a simple wine. It has sweet and sour flavors, like a sour cough drop.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ever since Tamber Bey made the switch from Oakville fruit to their vineyard in Yountville, their Cabernets have dropped in quality. This '09 is dry, tannic and uninteresting, with a harshness that makes it difficult to appreciate the blackberry and cherry fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Comes on a bit flat, with a streak of cardboard under the fruit. Not as fresh as it should be, given the vintage.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"We suggest very little time with this bulky, medicinal Tempranillo. Despite color and weight, it's prickly, sour and not too ripe. The flavors and finish are short, while the overriding impression is that it's underdeveloped.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"There are brambly notes here of forest floor and underbrush backed by enough fresh fruit to keep the wine chewy and fresh in the mouth. You'll also get notes of wet tobacco and wild mushroom that add complexity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"With a modern winery located at the foot of the picturesque town of Barolo, Cascina Adelaide proudly produces a bold and innovative interpretation of Barolo. This is a powerful and generous wine with big spice, berry, smoke and mineral tones. The cards it plays best, however, are intensity and persistency.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Here's a Prosecco from the Cartizze cru (offered by the excellent Bortolin estate) that boasts mineral notes and talc powder followed by plush, creamy peach and yellow fruit. The wine ends with a very feminine note of fresh flowers.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"With its rounded texture and smooth wood and yellow fruits, this is a generous wine. It has weight and some richness tempered with acidity and a prominent apple skin character. In another few months, the wine's richness will show better.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"For an $18 Oregon Pinot, you can't do much better than this well-made wine from a top-flight vintage. Brambly black cherry fruit carries a streak of cola, with ripe, moderate tannins balancing out a medium-long finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"It opens with aromas of forest floor, porcini mushroom and espresso. The straightforward palate offers bright berry, coffee and grilled herbs alongside firm tannins. Drink 2015\u20132020.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Atypically dark in color, this brassy Ch\u00e2teauneuf blanc comes across as aromatically muted. Then it's very neutral in flavor, with ample breadth but lacking in richness and depth. It's something of a conundrum.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Feels soft and cloyingly sweet in pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, and is beginning to be tired and old. Drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Full and round, with snappy acidity that brings life and lift to the luscious fruit, this delicious wine is aimed at those who like a festival of green and yellow fruits in their glass. It has fine texture and length, with a defining mineral streak that elevates this well beyond just fruity. It has medium-term aging potential as well.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is an ultrarich, ripe Cabernet, marked by jammy blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, with a milk chocolate sweetness and soft, intricate tannins. Made in the soft, modern style, it's best over the next six years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A bit rugged and hot in the mouth. Offers a good array of plummy cherry flavor, with bright, zingy acidity and a touch of smoky oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet. Dramatic in structure and flavor, with massively packed blackberries, dark chocolate and pain grill\u00e9. The wine was aged in 49% new oak, which adds smoky, spice overtones. Drink now and through 2013.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lightly fruity and fresh, a wine that has some crisp acidity although without much definition. The aftertaste is clean, bringing out attractive citrus and red currant fruits. Screwcap.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla. A fresh, citric palate delivers lime, green apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors, while the finish is clean as a new razor, with nothing off, bitter or pithy.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Dull and dusty on the nose, this burly Zin opens up in the glass, offering a slight sweetness of blackberry and vanilla amid its soft texture and structure.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Classic Lodi Cab, from a vintage that wasn't too hot or too cool. The wine is soft and lush, with milk chocolate and cassis flavors and the vanillins and sweet char of oak. Easy and delicious, it's a wine to drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This late-disgorged wine has been released at the age of 11 years. It's a beautiful wine, notable especially for the ultrafine feeling of the mousse, or bubbles. So refined and silky. Rich too are the flavors, in limes, strawberries, toasty lees and minerals. A spectacular sparkling wine that has many years of development ahead.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lots of zesty acidity in this Pinot Noir, giving the pomegranate, rhubarb, red cherry and licorice flavors a bright edge. The wine is very dry and complexly layered. Interesting now, if a bit primary in fruit, and balanced enough to develop additional nuances over the next six years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Butterscotch and pineapple and peach jam flavors mark this Chardonnay. Fortunately, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a certain minerality. It's an obvious crowd pleaser, and would score higher except for the seemingly sweet finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fresh berries, young spice and raw notes of blueberry and raspberry color this bright blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese from Central Italy. The wine is sharp and immediate in terms of the delivery of its easy tannins and bright, acidic finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Made from Tempranillo, this is a really pleasant ros\u00e9 that shows a balance rare in California. Totally dry, crisp and relatively low in alcohol, the wine manages to be long and deep in creamy, spicy cherry, raspberry and vanilla bean flavors. Great job.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Pungent of baked plum and baking spice, this Shenandoah Barbera is soft and rustic, yet refined, with a jolt of mocha espresso on the finish. The expert acidity enveloping this wine should pair with Mediterrean-themed food.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Big, bold and concentrated, this full-bodied wine was given the complete new-barrel, lees-stirring treatment. It has a deep gold color, with ripe pear and buttered toast aromas that transition to waves of pear and apple on the palate and lingering finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"If you like 'em big and oaky, then this one's for you. Aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, roasted red apples, buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound. The mouth is full and slightly fat, with moderate acidity and a medium-length, smoky finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A mix of vineyards and AVAs go into this blended Syrah, which is co-fermented with 6% Viognier. The Viognier is definitely present, and the wine has a top end of grapefruit and citrus, adding scent, flavor and acid. It's full, forward, acidic and a little hot, and delivers plenty of flavor up front. What's not quite there is the layering of flavors that some of the other Walter Dacon Syrahs express.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A finely structured wine, its tannin fitting well into the rich texture, with berry fruits, dark plums and bitter coffee adding an extra dimension.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"The aromas that greet you from the glass bring flowers, cherries, hints of cured meat and more. The wine is already drinking nicely, with an elegant mix of pie cherries and fruit pastry flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is the winery's flagship red; in this vintage it's 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Syrah. Sturdy and structured to age, the Syrah component pops in the pepper and spice, while the Cab and Merlot give it muscle and verve. Youthful, lovely floral notes and pure, pretty berry fruits shine in this ripe but graceful wine with sweet fruit, a pleasing midpalate and a clean and textural finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Nice and smooth, this Merlot is for early drinking. It's as plump as can be in cherries, cocoa, cola and tobacco, with soft acids and even softer tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"For the price, you get a Cabernet that shows some pretty good Napa character. It's ripe and forward with black currants with tough tannins and a hit of sweet oak. Lots going on, and could even age for a few years. If you drink it now, give it a couple hours of airing.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A food-friendly blend of Sangiovese, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc that shows easy but rich and intense fruit flavors of cherry and blackberry, plus a subtle spice note.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a firm and stony wine, with dry tannins that give structure to the intense acidity and the red cherry flavor. It's dense and concentrated, with a solid feel that demands several years of aging.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of black cherry, licorice, leather, violet and a whiff of tobacco open this wine. The palate is still a bit closed but delivers black raspberry, wild cherry, anisette and a note of black pepper alongside big, brooding tannins that need time to come around. Drink 2017\u20132024.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Fresh, full bodied and juicy, this has flavors of dusty, dark plum and chocolate. It was aged in both French and American oak, which has added a background note of tobacco and vanilla on the palate, particularly on the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Il Puro is a simple but genuine expression of Merlot with soft cherry nuances backed by light shadings of spice and mineral. The texture is smooth and silky, and although this is a very simple wine, it does deliver easy drinking pleasure.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Soft and rich with pineapple, lemon candy and oak flavors, this simple Chardonnay has the benefit of acidity for balance. It's a nice, basic Chard at an everyday price.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Light ruby in color, this offers fresh raspberry and red cherry aromas, slightly softer flavors of ripe plum and a smooth texture. It is medium bodied and easy to enjoy.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lasagna, meat-filled ravioli or mushroom risotto would make good pairing partners to this mild and crisp red. It offers notes of red berry, almond and cola.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Banfi presents an easy, no-fuss Chianti Classico that showcases Sangiovese typicity and personality. This is a profoundly food-friendly wine with built-in natural acidity that pairs it with butter or cream-based pasta dishes.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Notable for its firm minerality and acidity and distinguished mouthfeel. Could be a little richer, but offers intricate raspberry, sour cherry candy, blueberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Might blossom over the next few years. Drink now\u20132013.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"As with its Momtazi vineyard bottling, Boedecker Cellars produced just two barrels of this Cherry Grove designate. It's a fragrant and focused effort, scented with rose petals and cherry candy, and carrying a spicy cinnamon streak into a textural, cola-laced finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Given the diverse clonal make-up of the vines that go in to this Pinot, the aromas are somewhat muted and shy. Earthy, spicy fruit flavors are characterized by baked red raspberry and strawberry notes, with the wine taking on a denseness on the palate and finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This pleasing blend yields a spicy, fruity wine with sweet strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Though two thirds new oak was used, it is not prominent. Smooth and accessible, this delicious wine is accented with aromas of sweet straw.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"As much as we like the retro package, this time the contents are just too one-dimensional. The heavily toasted oak over the narrow fruit from the '98 vintage reads as just that\u2014toast, with vanilla and coconut shadings. Dry powdery tannins mark the taut finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This youthful expression of Dolcetto offers a dark, concentrated style and a very noticeable mineral tone that slices through the lush blueberry and raspberry aromas. The wine is tonic and vibrant and although there isn't huge complexity here, there is a good, fresh quality of fruit.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"It's incredibly rich and ripe in blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate, with a lovely veneer of toasted oak. The tannins are super smooth. Drink now\u20132020.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Blueberry fruit mingles with cinnamon-tinged oak spice on the nose and palate of this offering. There's even enough depth and complexity to make it more than a simple quaff, worthy of washing down simply roasted chicken perhaps.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Starts out nice, with a good, fruity raspberry nose, but on the palate are tastes of tomatoes, with a dry, astringent, tannic finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A lovely and complex Cabernet from this mountain in the southerly Mayacamas chain. It shows the big, firm tannins of its origins, with a dry sturdiness backing up the intense black currant flavors. Drinkable now for sheer decadence, although it also seems to have the stuffing to age for a decade.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Difficult to find much to like here. Smells baked and Porty, and tastes overtly sweet in residual sugar, like cherry and raspberry jam.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fermented and aged in stainless steel without going through malolactic fermentation, this steely, waxy Albarino is ready for tapas, offering big bold tastes of peach and apricot. Textured and long-lasting, its tangible acidity will make seafood, especially shellfish, sing.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An very pretty aromatic package with melon, pineapple, apple and pear. Good, and not hugely complex, but definitely casual and approachable. Imported by Halby Marketing.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of roses, lychee and pineapple, followed by appealing flavors of lemon, tropical fruit and flowers, give this wine a flirty but poised character. It's balanced and fresh, and best paired with summer salads and spicy ethnic cuisine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"It's a rustic, slightly raisiny Bordeaux blend (with a little Syrah also), sourced from excellent vineyards, but a bit overripe. Soft, forward and a little leathery, it's ready to drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Wood aging adds a smoky character and toasty flavor, while also smoothing out the tannins. From the rich 2009 vintage, this wine shows both plum fruits and firm tannins. It could still age, drink until 2018.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage. It's a wine that needs at least 5 years. Today, if you do open a bottle, watch for the mineral, stony character that pushes the fruit and demands attention.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Made in the modern style, this Chardonnay is very ripe and rich in jammy pineapples, green apples and limes, enhanced with smoky, caramelized oak and a creamy, slightly sour note of lees. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Best now and through 2012 before the fruit goes south.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"With cassis and plum aromas, this mid-weight Cabernet Sauvignon from the Foothills has a taste of licorice and vanilla, particularly on the finish, testament to its 33 months in new American oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A wine that is soft, rounded, ready to drink. It is without concentration or great acidity, but the white and light green fruits are delicious, giving an open character that is framed by toasty flavors and some spice.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Peppery and bright in acidity, this blend of half Grenache and lesser percentages of Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah and Counoise is a bit mixed. On the one hand it offers red raspberry and pomegranate and perfumed aromatics; on the other hand, the earthiness detracts.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Just about every Dyer Cabernet requires aging. The 2009 bottling is tough with tannins, despite intense blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. The winemaker held it back from release even longer than the 2010, but it's still juvenile, with unintegrated oak, fruit and mineral notes. The window of drinkability is 2015\u20132025.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This has a soapy mouthfeel, often an indicator for a high pH wine. The apple and pear fruit flavors are mild but thin.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The mildly floral nose leads to a lean and acidic palate, with flavors of lemon and green apple.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Very tannic, rough.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a light and easy Prosecco Extra Dry with notes that recall cut grass and hay. There's not much in the way of flower or fruit aromas, although there is a hint of ripe banana and cardboard. It's tonic and lean with crisp freshness on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"At the age of six-plus years, this Cab still is dominated by the 100% new French oak in which it was aged. The fruit flavor, too, is young and primary, offering sweetly ripe cherries and blackberries. Even the tannins are fresh. The suggestion is continued cellaring, and the statistics concerning alcohol, acidity and pH suggest ideal balance. Hold for at least a year and try again.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Exotic and complex, this medium-bodied, structured wine is awash with aromas, from charcuterie and mixed nut to cedar and pencil. Anchoring it is a dusty tannic profile and a punch of oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The color of oxblood, this meaty, tannic wine pours espresso, black licorice and composted earth around tart blackberry fruit. It's aromatic, spicy and nicely balanced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"As sweet as Port, with chocolate and prune flavors. Feels as hot as a chile pepper, with nearly 17% alcohol.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a pure Cab Franc, stylish and varietal. The new oak was limited to just 30%, giving a kick to the natural toastiness of the grape. The fruit mixes blueberries, black cherry and a streak of cassis, then runs into luscious mocha and espresso, with highlights of black pepper and cedar. The tannins have been beautifully managed.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The 79% Syrah component is estate-grown; while the 21% Grenache comes from the Lonesome Springs vineyard. What a lovely nose, with the bright and grapey Grenache shining through and adding pretty floral scents, while the Syrah fills in the berries and peppery tannins. This is still quite purple and youthful, fresh and just a bit volatile.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a challenging Zin. It's fruity but it's also earthy and mushroomy, with a blast of vanilla oak. Right now it's pretty tannic, but beneath that roughness is a core of fruit. It's austere now\u2014difficult even\u2014but some time in the cellar could soften and open it.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Smooth and dry, with appealing flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar, and a fine, spicy finish. Shows amazing style and elegance for the price. A real sommelier's bargain, with 2,853 cases produced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101. With good acidity, it's a very respectable table wine from a weak vintage.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Bold and full bodied, this offers aromas of steeped plum, prune, clove and blue flower. The concentrated, savory palate doles out mature blackberry, raisin, clove and licorice. Big but velvety tannins and just enough freshness give this a surprisingly drinkable quality that belies its heft.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Smells very earthy and funky, with a strong hit of green pepper. More bell pepper and some cracked black pepper appear on the palate, which features some currant, licorice and lots of oak. Bright acidity helps it along, but it just can't escape its vegetal core, which holds it back.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, showing sweet raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Brilliant acidity and wonderfully soft tannins make this Pinot instantly drinkable, yet it should age over the next 6\u20138 years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Chris Dowsett makes just a single Gew\u00fcrztraminer each year, always from Celilo vines planted in 1982. 2010 was the coolest vintage in two decades at this high-altitude site. If you love searing acidity, married to varietal spice, rose petals, lemons, grapefruit, star fruit and gooseberries, you are in for a treat. Fermented in neutral French oak and left on the lees, this could age for decades.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine's judiciously restrained nose shows black fruits and dried herbs, with asphalt and focused rather than exuberant fig and plum aromas. There is lots of minty lift at the tip of the palate, which opens toward Mission figs, fudge and mocha.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This Chardonnay has brisk, crisp acidity and flavors of pineapple, orange and mango. There are dominating notes of buttered toast and sweet butterscotch.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine from one of Anderson Valley's pioneers has a lighter-than-usual color and plenty of red cherry, raspberry and turned earth aromas. It offers low-level fruit flavors and good balance of acidity versus ripeness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This red Passito dessert wine from Tuscany offers bittersweet aromas of wild cherry, raspberry, cassis and cola. It makes a simple but clean impression in the mouth and would pair with chocolate brownies or cherry pie.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine boasts an oak-driven character, with aromas of espresso, coffee and toasted almond. The palate shows red and black fruit layered with accents of oak, chocolate and black pepper. Technically well made, it's shy on personality and length.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A little too soft in both acidity and tannins to have perfect structure, but it's fine enough, and the flavors certainly are complex and compelling. They range from blackberry tart and cherry pie through Dr. Pepper cola and anise liqueur to bacon and sandalwood. If that sounds good, it is. Ready now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a well-balanced wine that is both crisp and breezy and full of delicious red-berry fruits. It has a tight texture, with some minerality and a tangy aftertaste. This should make for an excellent ap\u00e9ritif.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Ero is packed tight with bright berry, cassis and white almond. That all-Sicilian jamminess you sometimes find in this variety is absent here.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"An evenly dispersed nose of sage bark, cherry compote and lightly toasted cedar introduces this bottling by Fred Brander, a Santa Ynez Valley winemaking pioneer now actively trying to create a new Los Olivos District appellation. The flavors are balanced between cherry fruit and oak, with smooth tannins throughout.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Heavy and sweet, this wine has melted cherry-jam and Dr. Pepper flavors and some heat from the alcohol.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Syrah from coastal Tuscany opens with bright fruit, a somewhat lean texture and delivers lively berry notes of wild strawberry and white cherry. A good value, the wine would pair well with pizza or pasta.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Consistent with the rather lean house style this opens with herbal aromas set against firm, varietal cassis and blue plum fruit. The grapes come from a block planted in 1985. Some barrel spice adds cinnamon to the nose, and there's a touch of Cab Franc (6%) in the blend, which stiffens up the tannins. Retasting this wine after it has spent a few extra months in bottle, it's smoothed out a bit, and the sweet black- cherry fruit has moved forward. This should age really well.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors. It's notable for grippy tannins that give it a firm, dry mouthfeel.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a silly name, and it's not a very good wine. Acids and tannins dominate, making it astringent and bitter, and the cherry fruit is thin and rather overripe.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Though not planted until 2001, the east-facing Lone Oak Vineyard is adjacent to the legendary vines of Garys' and Rosella's. The nose conveys lemon-lime soda and white rock minerality, and flavors combine baked apple, yeasty bread and lime. Bright acidity exhilarates the tongue, making a perfect partner for a lunch of shellfish, halibut or chicken salad.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A gorgeously salmon-colored ros\u00e9 made predominantly from Grenache (62%) co-fermented dry with Viognier (58%) out of Yolo County. The wine has a delicately pretty nose of peach and a light-medium body despite its 14.8% alcohol, though the finish falls off fast.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The most impressive of the fine range of wines from this producer, the wine is structured and dense without ever losing sight of balance, fruit and acidity. That makes for a wine that has a dusty texture coupled with a dry center of fruit and wood tannins. The acidity and the juicy berry fruits give freshness. Everything is ready for long aging. Drink from 2019.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This elegant effort is 46% Cab Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 18% Cab Franc; still wrapped up tight and showing tart cassis and berry fruit. There is a lot of the classic Ciel minerality underlying the fruit, with hard tannins and lightly peppery herbal details. At just 14.1% alcohol, this is a classic example of how Washington brings bright New World fruit and terroir to a style that retains the elegance of the Old World.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Pretty notes of Italian espresso, chocolate and spice revolve around a core of solid black fruit. This is an elegant and refined wine that boats a traditional style that is never overdone or too powerful. In fact, it showcases its delicate berry nuances very nicely in the mouth. Drink after 2014.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Strong , complex aromas, with notes of tropical fruit and coconut. In the mouth, it's oaky and spicy, with penetrating, bright, effusive flavors that you might go so far as to call racy. The alcohol content is high and it drinks a little soft, but this is a very seductive wine. A crowd-pleaser, for sure.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet and Refosco that's aged in French oak, this opens with bold, black intensity, bearing notes of dark fruit, ripe blackberry and sweet spice. The mouthfeel is chewy and soft, with a touch of pulpy sweetness on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Baking spice and toasted wood add warmth to preserved black cherry and plum flavors in this bold, lushly textured Cabernet Franc. The tannins are quite soft, but the dense fruit profile gives it weight and body.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This extremely limited (47 cases) Syrah is dedicated to the owners' daughter Jaden, who is pictured on the label. Very classy Wahluke Slope fruit sends up citrus, spice, pineapple and lime aromas over bright, sappy raspberry and cherry fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Bold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates. There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past. The thyme and rosemary streak continues into and through the finish, while the fruit maintains its power and polish, with just the lightest barrel influence perceptible in a kiss of toast.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Clos de la Chapelle surrounds an old chapel in the Morgeot Premier Cru. This 2010 is full, ripe and intense, with yellow fruit and toast flavors that combine with tight acidity to create richness and structure. Complex, concentrated and age worthy.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A refined and complex Syrah from the \u201cGrand Cru\u201d of Minervois la Liviniere. Raspberry, blueberry, rosemary and thin mint flesh out the velvety texture, supported by a solid backbone of gripping tannins and balanced acidity. Coffee and cocoa notes develop on the lush, lingering finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Firm and compact, it mixes wild berry, plum and cassis fruits, giving this Cab-dominated blend the sleek appeal of a good St. Emilion, but without the aggressive herbaceousness. There is no obvious new oak here, but lovely suggestions of barrel that never override the superb fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"No, that's not a typo. The ??? Vineyard bottling conceals (intentionally) the fruit sources for these grapes, which come from one of Oregon's most expensive and highly-reviewed producers. It's crystal-clear in both appearance and flavor, building upon a cranberry\/raspberry base into a potent young wine with expressive purity. A streak of gun metal, often found in consulting winemaker Robert Brittan's own wines, adds a stylish note to the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Some wines have a personality that makes you want to smile. This is one of them. A big, rich, friendly wine full of fruit that was approachable and easy to drink. It is not particularly serious, nor should it be put down for long aging. But drink it now with a burger or roast chicken and it will give pleasure.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A bouquet dominated by banana with some spicy vanilla notes and more banana in the mouth. Has more persistence than most Grigios, with a lean, spicy finish. Imported by Opici Import Company.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a syrupy, rich, meaty wine that opens with impressive intensity and extraction. It's a bruiser and a pleaser that delivers aromas of cherry liqueur, blackberry jam and exotic spice. It's also a masculine, opulent wine that could use a few more years of cellar aging.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A beautiful Chardonnay, notable for its elegant structure. Perfect acidity and just a hint of tannins, much of it from oak barrels, provide the framework for the pineapple and kiwi fruit flavors, enriched with notes of cream and buttered toast.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a ripe, warm, full-bodied Cr\u00e9mant. It has a creamy, rich mousse, soft citrus and light acidity. The wine is forward, fruity and fresh, lightly tangy at the end.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Fine ripe fruit shows on this full-flavored wine, but there is as much of the vanilla, toast and spice character as there is of the peach note. The texture, though, is all fruit, tight apple skins with final fresh acidity.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A ripe and spicy blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this has ripe black fruits that are laced with firm, dry tannins. There is a herbal character that gives it an edge.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of raw oak, cinnamon, bacon and clove outmuscle fruit on this rough, tannic, scraping 2013. Flavors of toast, chocolate and baking spices push blackberry and black-plum fruit towards an oaky, abrasive finish with rocky tannins and accents of chocolate and cinnamon. Holding this for another couple of years may or may not soften this fierce but tasty RDD.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Ripe and soft, with smooth toast-inspired texture and blackberry fruits on the rich side. It is still young, needing another year to pull firmly together, but its elegance already shows.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Even though it is weighty, very full and dense, the wine has a fine balance, with acidity that cuts through the richness.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Aged in new barriques, this opens with aromas of oak and oak-driven spices and a whiff of savory herbs. The palate is dominated by oak, vanilla and coffee that muffle the dried dark-cherry and mineral flavors. It has a linear quality but lacks fruit richness and is still in the vice-like grip of wood tannins.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine manages to combine some of the delicacy and elegance of Margaux with the richness of 2003. Under the direction of Claire Villars (also of Ch\u00e2teau Ferri\u00e8re classed growth), there is a confidence in this estate and its vineyards which lie adjacent to Ch\u00e2teau Margaux. Great acidity and black fruits finish the ensemble.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A bit too oaky and extracted. Trades these winemaker elaborations for the natural subtlety of the grapes. Rich in cherries and raspberries, but heavy-handed. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This relatively dark-colored ros\u00e9 features nicely perfumed aromas of fruit blossoms and black cherries, then adds a hint of dark chocolate to the palate. It's fullish, but not heavy, balanced by some lemony notes on the finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Kind of like Pinot Grigio, in that it's a delicate, unoaked (although leesy) wine with citrusy, figgy flavors and bright, citrusy acidity leading to a slightly sweet finish. It's food-versatile and user-friendly.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this is the most elegant and delicate of the winery's current bubblies. It's a dry, sophisticated wine, with subtle citrus, peach, apple and yeast flavors. If you've never cellared a sparkling wine, try stashing this away for up to a decade.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is tart in acidity and tastes of raspberry jam, with a bubblegum-gassiness reminiscent of Beaujolais. It's easy and refreshing.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From a mix of vineyards, this tastes of berries, raisins, cooked plums, and baking spices. The tannins are hard and slightly bitter, and there seems to be a hint of residual sugar, perhaps to mitigate the bitterness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a strong, oaky, ripe Chardonnay, grown on a mountain better known for Cabernet. It's powerful and intense in pineapple tart, pear marmalade, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that have been liberally oaked, and it shows the creamy influence of lees. Not particularly subtle, it's a wine you don't want to drink too cold.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Not much going on in this watery wine. It tastes like alcohol with a few drops of grapefruit juice.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Raw and fresh, with jammy mulberry, blackberry and pepper flavors. A rustic wine for rustic food.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Soft, slightly sweet and simple, this Syrah has fairly modest blackberry, licorice flavors and cola flavors. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Given its modest price and weighty alcohol, this wine should find many admirers. Thick and tannic, it could pass for a heavier red than Pinot Noir, and it offers bulky, rustic fruit flavors, with some heat on the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine adds to the growing case to be made for Cabernet Sauvignon in Livermore Valley. Mother Vine Reserve is a smallish offering for Concannon, loaded with black olive, tea and black pepper. It's Cab Franc-esque in some way, yet intensely dark, brooding and velvety.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"These \u201cOriginal Vines\u201d are in fact the oldest Pinot Gris vines in the country. They deliver exquisite details of earth and stone around a solid core of apple and Asian pear. It's bone dry, with exceptional depth.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made with Sangiovese, Locorosso has an intense fragrance of wild cherry and underbrush accented by tobacco and spice. The palate is dense and delicious, delivering black cherry layered with carob, coffee and white pepper notes. It's already enjoyable so drink soon.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"There's good Santa Barbara character in this Chardonnay, with brisk acidity and minerality girding the tropical fruit and peach flavors. It's a little thin, but elegantly structured.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very sweet and delicious, a true Port-style wine that's high in acidity and packed with tannins. But the sugar level is so high, it makes the wine drinkable now. The flavors are of chocolate, red currants and vanilla.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Although the vineyard is source to some very great bottlings by others, this one has a sharpness throughout that detracts. The green mint taste suggests unripe tannins to the red cherries and pomegranates. Unlikely to age, so drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fresh and jammy, with sharp acidity and berry flavors that taste right out of the fermenter. Seems like it was released awfully young, but might calm down in a few months.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Polished and balanced, this masterpiece shows restraint and it's already drinkable. With its great acidity and its fine intermingling of spice and red fruit flavors, this wine will appeal to lovers of Gamay and Pinot Noir.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This plush, rich expression of Pinot Grigio from northeast Italy would pair with white meat, seafood risotto or spicy dishes from the Far East. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and long-lasting.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"You can almost smell the minerals and acids in this Chardonnay. The flavors verify the aroma, adding fruitier notes of limes, sweet apples and white peaches, complexed with the creamy, smoky nuances of new oak and sur lies aging.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A bit heavy for a ros\u00e9, without quite the liveliness you want. It's a very fruity wine, with forward raspberry, vanilla, cocoa and spice flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A lovely wine, soft and charming, but far from simple. Although it has complex layers of cherries, blackberries, cassis and cedar, it also shows a fine structure of ripe, smooth tannins and supporting acidity. Drink now\u20132015 while it's fresh and forward.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This lands on the sweet side of the corral, and has a good texture of tannins and acidity as well as oodles of grapy, blackberry jam flavors to complete the package. It's full bodied, rich in mouthfeel, and the ripe fruit character stays on the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is pure S\u00e9millon, barrel fermented in new American oak, from a new, Spokane-based winery. S\u00e9millon makes some of the best white wines in Washington, though consumer interest has been tepid. This shows the barrel influence with a rich coconut flavor, wrapped into sleek fruit flavors of white peach, green apple and a hint of cucumber.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors. It has good acidity and a firm structure that should hold it together for three or four years. With aging, it may integrate and develop further.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A beautiful copper color, deep and dense. Modeled on the wines of Provence's Domaines Ott, this ros\u00e9 was designed, says the winemaker, to age. It's whole-cluster fermented from Grenache vines that have been picked and grown specifically to be a ros\u00e9\u2014not a saign\u00e9e. Compact, compressed and powerful with an emphasis on the mineral subtext, light peach and strawberry highlights.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This hearty Montepulciano d'Abruzzo from a relatively hot vintage (2005) offers loads of ripe, jammy fruit, plum and prune backed by exotic spice and black peppercorn. The wine shows solid, dark tannins on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Perfumed, floral and intriguing, this is still tight with mountain tannins. In a few years, its thick black-cherry and pepper tones will emerge, becoming rounded out with notes of violet and oaky leather.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This ripe, lush Syrah boldly expresses itself with shiny, saturated colors and bright, spicy, assertive fruit. It's a full-bodied, sappy wine, forward and plump, and the deep core of blackberry fruit is enhanced with pepper, citrus peel, clove and other spices. Young and still grapey, it's delicious right now but can be cellared for some years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The softness and rusticity that almost always mark Sierra Foothills wines are here, yet the wine rises to what might be called coastal elegance. A Spanifornia blend of Tempranillo and Cab Sauvignon, it has a complexity that unfolds in waves of blackberry, tobacco, clove, anise and espresso. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Young and yeasty, this is a style best consumed early. It refreshes like a light beer, quick and clean, with bracing acidity, but not much in the way of fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Having never tried this producer's wines, we can only heap praise on this medium-bodied, more modern style of Rioja. Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors. Firm and mildly tannic, with ample new oak leaving lasting flavors of vanilla, coffee and pepper. Hold for another year or so, if possible; 900 cases produced.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Fruity, rich and honey-sweet, with decadent flavors of peach and pear jam, apricot, pineapple, green apple and vanilla, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. There's a good spine of acidity for balance.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This 100% Syrah shows intense blackberry, cr\u00e8me de cassis and plum sauce flavors, plus hints of charred bone and black pepper. It's dry, and the tannins are firm but supple. The alcohol is high, but it's balanced with the wine's fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Full-bodied and juicy. Offers a wealth of blackberry, black cherry, plum, tobacco, bacon and pepper spice flavors that are housed in thick tannins. Production was 4,877 cases, so should be easy to find.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The most notable thing about this Pinot is its intensity of flavor. A blend of both new Dijon clones and older California selections of Pinot Noir, it is stunning with flavors of raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper. It's a balanced, elegant wine with vibrant texture , but needs time to truly shine. Hold till at least 2017.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Nice and oaky and rich, from a vineyard in the heart of the cool-climate southern part of Russian River Valley. Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a new winery for me, and it's a promising start. The wine is decadently rich in cassis, cherries, milk chocolate and vanilla flavors, but it has the structural integrity of a fine wine. While acidity is soft, the tannins have the grip of cherry skins, while oak adds its own tannic complexities.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fermented 75% whole-cluster and then aged in neutral oak, this wine offers complex, expressive aromas of green olive, fresh herbs, grilled asparagus, earth and peat. The palate brings waves of intensity, with sensuous, layered savory flavors that lead to a hyperextended finish. It's an exclamation point of a wine that shows the promise of this young winery and vineyard.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lots of bang for the buck here. Offers mouth-filling, juicy blackberry, cherry, pomegranate and coffee flavors in a bone-dry, soft wine, with a fairly complicated tannin structure. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a very ripe wine stuffed with blackberries, cherries and cocoa, but it's also pretty tannic, although sweet oak softens the blow. Feels lush and good, but rustic around the edges. Drink now with beef dishes.","completion":"US"}

{"prompt":"This is the kind of wine that will be wildly popular as a cocktail sipper. It has the fruit, spice and oaky vanilla to appeal to almost all palates, yet is dry and crisp in acidity, leaving behind a clean, fruity finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From the Gravina appellation in Puglia (southern Italy), this charming blend of Greco (60%) and Malvasia (40%) opens with easy aromas of pear, Golden Delicious apple and drying mineral or talc powder. It's tonic and fresh in the mouth and would pair with tomato bruschetta and fresh basil.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A powerfully ripe, toasty wine, showing all the richness of 2005 in Chablis, and adding a layer of structure to go with the apples and cream richness. At the center, there is green minerality.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Dry and savory, this blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier has a tangy spine of minerality that frames lusher notes of papaya, white peach, lemon zest, nectarine and vanilla. Finishes with a refreshing touch of citrusy acids.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a light, fresh and fruity wine, with an attractive red-berry flavor, plus acidity and a soft structure.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1\/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Always a very dry, elegant Pinot Noir, Signorello's '08 Las Amigas again displays those qualities. It shows dried raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, with a distinct minerality and a dusting of tobacco and black pepper. This fancy Pinot is a natural lamb or steak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Cola, cherry, mocha and vanilla flavors, in a light-bodied, silky wine, with pronounced acidity. Finishes dry. A bit rustic, but offers good Pinot character.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Paleo (a pure expression of Cabernet Franc from Coastal Tuscany) is a drop dead gorgeous wine with amazing intensity and purity of aromas. You get it all here: Bright berry notes, drying mineral, exotic spice, cooling acidity and firm, satisfying structure. It's a rich, velvety and beautiful wine that will award you a memorable drinking experience now or in 10 years time.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Oxidative and spicy. Effusive mineral notes provide complexity but turn heavy in the mouth without fruit for balance. Crisp, with a silky texture and a short-to-medium finish.","completion":"France"}

{"prompt":"Here's a bright Friulano with a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, peach and passion fruit. The wine tastes soft and supple in the mouth and delivers loads of fruity peach flavors on the close. What's nice about this wine is that it delivers high structure and lively fruit fragrances at the same time.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Oak dominates the overall character of this wine, with forward notes of toasted wood, tobacco leaf, roasted coffee bean and a hint of plum. There's more wood than fruit here.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Simple and direct, with minty flavors of blackberries, licorice, cola, peppercorns and vanilla. On the plus side, the wine is fully dry, the tannins smooth.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a good price for a Cab so rich and supple. It's very deep in flavor, with flavors of blackberry pie filling, milk chocolate, anise and sweet oak, yet it's softly balanced and dry. Just delicious for drinking now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a soft, broadly fruity Chardonnay, with near-tropical ripeness. Banana and papaya flavors dominate, accented by pretty baking spices and a touch of mineral.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Somebody was carried away with wood here. The wine is totally dominated by flavors of burnt wood\u2014 even the 50% new wood was too much in 2007. That said, the fruit could increase in weight and black berry flavors. But not just yet\u2014in another three to four years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Le Focaie is a great value wine with easy but one-dimensional fruit characteristics of cherry, blackberry and cinnamon spice. The wine's natural thickness and consistency recalls the sunniest vineyards of southern Tuscany.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"There's a wild, feral quality to this fine Pinot Noir. It has forest flavors of wild mushrooms, thyme, fennel, anise and pine, along with more familiar flavors of red cherries, cola and sandalwood. Elegant and ageable. Now through 2012.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Crushed stone and dried clay notes lend a distinctly earthen character to this dry light-bodied Riesling. Pressed apple and pear flavors on the palate are freshened by squirts of lime, lemon and a tart green-plum finish. The finish is long and lingering.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The weight of the structure is almost overpowering for the fresh blackberry fruits in the wine. Its presence is big, powerful, with bitter fruits and black figs, finishing with a final punch of richness.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Quite a distinguished '99, with its flamboyant aromas of spicy blackcurrants and cassis, with an oaky overlay of smoke and vanilla. Feels good as soon as it hits the palate, with blackberry flavors that last through the finish. The jolt of dry tannins that makes the palate puckery suggests midterm aging.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This gets an extra year in barrel and bottle prior to release. It's two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Syrah and 5% Petit Verdot. Still tart and tannic, the wine carries a full load of herb and earth characteristics, with less impact from the fruit than the high alcohol would suggest.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Unfortunately only available in Bermuda, this wonderful bottling shows salted brambleberries, crushed violets, asphalt, rosemary and pinpointed florality on the fresh yet concentrated nose. The palate is zesty and darkly focused, with elderberries, stewed plums, thyme and Earl Grey tea. It's quite a complex effort.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This captivating wine treads the line between Rh\u00f4ne and Bordeaux. A splash of Cabernet, though just a fraction of the blend, stands out. The wine has depth and persistence, and the mix of grapes works well, showing brambly red fruits, like a Zin, spice and pepper, like Syrah, and some herbal and leafy tobacco in the finish. Complex, unique and quite appealing.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This no-fuss blend of Chardonnay and Fiano offers simple tones of citrus and pear that segue to a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Pair this fresh southern Italian white with insalata di mare (seafood salad).","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Medium intense notes of sweet grass, fresh red apple slices, green melon and lime citrus on the nose and mouth. Medium weight with moderate, supporting acidity and a clean finish. Drink now.","completion":"France"}

{"prompt":"Aromas of chocolate mint, creamy vanilla and candy reflect a heavy-handed oak treatment, and a sweet burnt cherry and chocolate mint character is present throughout. Creamy on the tongue, but confected in terms of flavors and finish.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Ripe and fleshy in young fruit, this Cab, with minor amounts of Cab Franc and Merlot, shows black currant, plum, cherry and cedar flavors, with a dry-sweet dusting of crushed brown herbs and spices. Fairly tannic and tight now, it's balanced enough for mid-term aging. Best 2008\u20132012.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"After an early blast of gaseous sulfur, this heavyweight Tempranillo smells of toasted oak, graphite, latex and alcohol. The palate is lush, meaty, jammy and borderline syrupy, while flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate finish with depth and extreme richness. Drink through 2025.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Terre di Maria is a Sicilian blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Pinot Noir that opens with dark concentration and savory aromas of spice, cured meat, smoked bacon and dark berry fruit. The bouquet is slightly muddled but the mouthfeel is bright and fresh.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Intricate aromas and spicy, complex flavors make this medium-bodied wine an adventure to drink. It smells like cherries and cloves and wood smoke, tastes nicely ripe but dry, and has an appetizing, tannic grip in the texture.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Eric Hamacher has done a fine job with this wine. At 13.6% alcohol it is in fine balance, with a precise mix of strawberry, pie cherry, root beer and herb flavors. It's medium bodied, open and accessible, but not too simple. There is no reason to wait, but it could be cellared for up to six years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A little sharp and minty, this Pinot is very dry, with acidic flavors of cherries and cola. The mouthfeel is silky. It's not going anywhere, so drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Hot in high alcohol, which gives a burn that accentuates the pepper spice and makes it fierce. Yet it's fully dry and rich in blackberry, blueberry, anise and tobacco flavors. Defines the California superripe Zinfandel style.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This firm, dry wine is all tannins and bitter extraction. It has a hard side to it that the juicy fruit cannot balance.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Soft and round, with an explosive burst of candied fruit on the palate, this Barbera has concentrated flavors of dried cherry, plum and milk chocolate, the latter of which pops on the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness. There is also a more serious mineral texture that comes with tangy acidity. Age this wine for a few more months and drink from the end of 2017.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A rustic wine with strong, edgy tannins and modest cherry and coffee flavors. It's very dry and astringent, but will soften with beef.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ripe and generously oaked on the palate, this Chardonnay has flavors of pineapple jam, buttered toast and buttered popcorn. It's brightened with crisp acidity.","completion":"US"}

{"prompt":"Rubesco Riserva is a dark and sophisticated wine (a 70-30 blend of Sangiovese and Canajolo) with big aromas of red fruit and exotic spice. This vintage (2003 was an exceptionally hot year) shows extra ripeness on the fruit and a touch of bitterness on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Toasty, with notes of slightly menthol-like oak layered over ripe blackberry fruit. It's a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp, tart and mouthwatering. Give it another 6\u201312 months to better integrate the oak, then drink it over the next five or so years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Generous and opulent, this is a wood-aged wine in which the fruit plays a delicious part. Blackberry juice and acidity play counterpoint to toasty wood flavors and dark tannins. There is a fine, toasty aftertaste that promises good aging. Drink from 2015.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This Clerc-Milon, under the same winemaking team as Mouton Rothschild, is an attractive wine, not heavy, already quite soft. It seems to have been heavily extracted, in a New World style, with new wood aromas and flavors, losing something of Pauillac, but a winner in that it's immediately attractive. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This opens with aromas of dark berry, toast, espresso and a whiff of dark cooking spice. The bracing palate offers unripe cherry, licorice, powdered sage and toasted oak alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent, mouth-puckering finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"With this wine, Venge has taken a giant leap into the front ranks of California Syrah producers. It's made from fruit that's sourced from the great Stagecoach Vineyard, which straddles Atlas Peak\u2014a cool mountain region. The acidity is preserved, and the concentrated fruit easily handles the 60% new French oak. Dramatic and high in alcohol, this selection is gorgeous to drink now, and it will remain fresh over the next six years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ripe, open and packed with melon and tropical fruit flavors, this wine is already showing enticing drinkability. Its fresh, ripe fruits is layered with some mineral character and an under-cushion of wood.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A dark, rich, ripe Syrah that defines the California style, and preserves the fine structure that this cool-climate region lends to red wines. The wine is dry and tannic, and the flavors, of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak, are just delicious. Now and for a few years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Brander has struggled with Merlot. This year's bottling achieve plenty of cherry-berry and mocha fruit. The challenge continues to be the tannic structure, but improvement is notable.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Excellent color on this firmly fruity wine. It has an attractive edge of tannins giving it good structure while showing all of the fresh nouveau fruit.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Cantina Tre Serre is a well-priced and informal Barbera with a thin and informal style backed by fruity freshness. There's even a tiny touch of effervescence that adds a perky and peppery sensation to the mouthfeel.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This solidly structured wine shows the firm tannins and mineral structure typical of wines from C\u00f4te du Py. It has dense black cherry fruits along with sacidity that cuts through the structure. It could age another year, but is worth drinking now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Each year this value red blend is surprisingly different. With Syrah as the main component, it's spicier, more sappy and loaded with bright and forward berry flavors. The Bordeaux grapes that fill in the second half of the blend add notes of herb, earth, leaf and a hint of stone. It's a delicious, fine value.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Just over 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Malbec (10%), Petit Verdot (8%) and Merlot, this wine offers brooding but well-delineated aromas and flavors of blackberry, dried flowers, black tea, herbs, earth, barrel spices and light meaty notes. It's packed tightly with firm tannins and also shows great length. Drink 2022\u20132028.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Sweet-pea vines and green herbs add freshness to the perfumed flower and luscious peach-nectar notes. A classically-styled Pinot Gris, this is dry yet mouthfilling and rich. It finishes long, with notes of stone fruit and black tea leaves.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Rounder and more fruity than the inaugural 2007 Pinot Gris, this has succulent green apple and Bosch pear flavors balanced against crisp, refreshing acids.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"One wishes that Mike Januik made more Rieslings, as the few he's made from Bacchus Vineyard fruit have been excellent. This is made in a bright, spicy, palate-pleasing style, and it offers lively flavors of citrus, orange and pear. A hint of mint, a splash of jasmine tea, and an engaging, long, refreshing finish all add to the pleasure.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The best of the new releases from Michael Florentino, which has changed hands since this vintage was harvested. Autumnal flavors marry vivid, distinctive fruit to hints of leaf and citrus, elegant and complex.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way. The tannins, oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries, pomegranates, cola, tangerine, vanilla and spices, giving the wine a silky, complex, mellow mouthfeel. Beautifully dry and lush now, and should develop through 2012.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Give this tough, young Cabernet a good long decant before serving. At first, it's dominated by sharp acidity and mouth-numbing tannins. But after some airing, it offers black currant flavors. This is likely not an ager.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution? Probably, because the tannins promise aging and the intensely aromatic nature of the fruit points to a potentially fine wine. Just don't drink it yet.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Get a case of this and make it your house wine for easy drinking. It's dry and spicy, and has enough cherry, berry and cola flavors to satisfy your tastebuds.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Cherry, citrus rind and oak make for a short, stout nose. It seems more precise on the palate, with pure cherry and coffee flavors poking through a veil of tight tannins. Gets even firmer on the finish, with a smack of raisin. A wine that requires airing; or more cellar time.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Smooth and ripe, this Bordeaux blend pleases for its rich array of blackberry, cherry and spicy plum flavors. The texture is soft and chocolaty. Loses a point or two for the sugary finish, though. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"2008 was a great vintage for Tax, and this Santa Barbara bottling is a great value. It really delivers, offering a dry, elegantly structured and complex wine. The silky texture houses savory flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and sandalwood, with an umami taste of bacon. Just delicious for drinking now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Bone dry with aromas of freshly pressed apples, this is an austere but elegant sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. With notes of delicate white florals and yeast in the backdrop, the palate has a savory, dusty quality accented by a racy acidity and strong, minerally finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A bit rough and ready, but shows basic Cabernet quality in the full-bodied flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and smoky oak. Good for a tailgate party.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Nice and ripely sweet in fresh blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this Syrah is made for drinking now. It's dry and rich in tannins, with a soft, velvety mouthfeel. Shows interesting complications of smoked meats, pepper, cola and minerals.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Von Strasser has a good track record with this wine, and the '05 is right up there with the best, but be forewarned. It's very tannic. But then, it is from Diamond Mountain. Give it a good 4 years, at least, to throw some sediment and let the rich blackberry and black currant flavors emerge. Should hold well for 15 years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fans of the ripe, modern style of Chardonnay will fall in love with this bottling. It's strong in toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream and peach, pear and pineapple jam flavors that dazzle and wow the palate. Easy to find, with nearly 17,000 cases produced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Straightforward, this Chard shows well-ripened flavors of pineapple jam, nectarines, peaches and vanilla. It finishes with caramelized, butterscotchy sweetness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Unbalanced, with lots of acidity, hard tannins and raisiny flavors alongside green ones.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A very nice Syrah, dark and dry and full-bodied. Although it's a bit young and thick in jammy, primary fruit flavors, it's smooth and balanced. With rich blackberry pie, chocolate, violet, beef carpaccio, bacon and pepper flavors, it should develop through 2011.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fruity and easy, this soft wine has sweet flavors of apricots and caramel. Valdigui\u00e9, formerly known as Napa Gamay, is a red grape, and that accounts for the note of crushed raspberries.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here is a beautifully extracted and voluptuous Barolo from the Cannubi cru that would pair with tender veal shank, slow cooked until falling off the bone. Black cherry, spice, root beer and fragrant earthy tones all appear on the nose and the wine closes with tight, firm structure. Cellar age ten years or more.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the grapes for this stunning wine came from David Abreu's vineyard in the St. Helena foothills. It's very complex, softer, more open and approachable than Colgin's 100% Cabs, with a flamboyant spectrum of cherries,  framboise, cocoa, violets, gingerbread and spices framed in supple, fine tannins. Beautiful, a feminine wine of great beauty. Drink now through 2015.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a pale and luminous ros\u00e9 from Southern Italy with a pinkish-peach color and delicate aromas of stone fruit, wild berries, white cherries and a touch of chopped mint or basil. The wine is tart but also slightly sweet in the mouth and there's a touch of bitter almond on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's \u201croble\u201d designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Here's an absolutely terrific, but informal sparkling ros\u00e9 from southern Italy (made with Negroamaro grapes). Sweet berry, chopped mint and peach come to the fore and the wine is soft and slightly sweet. It's easy, fresh and would make a great cocktail choice.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Although this is Ste. Michelle's widely available Merlot offering, it breaks the mold by being held back a considerable time prior to release. It's an unusual wine, with scents of overripe, raisined fruit, a streak of tobacco and black licorice, a soft midpalate, and some bitterness in the finishing tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The dilute, grapey flavors are candied, and a pile of charred lumber doesn't make them go down any easier. A simple wood-and-juice quaff.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is a lovely Zinfandel, soft and appealing. It has fine balance and is dry and rich in cherry, currant, Proven\u00e7al herb, spice and tobacco flavors. Shows real complexity as it changes in the glass.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Hot and unbalanced in fruit, with flavors that span the gamut from raisins to mint, this Zin is bone dry. It's a rustic wine, with some rugged tannins and a coarse finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Amador Foothill does a good job with Sangiovese, and this dry ros\u00e9 is made from that variety. It's a cheerful wine, brisk in acidity and with delicate but complex cherry, rose petal and lavender flavors. The winemaker recommends bouillabaisse, which is a pretty good suggestion.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Veneered with oak, the nose bears strong aromas of carpenter's shop and charred sugar, with notes of dark stone fruit and cranberry sauce lingering beneath. While initially soft and syrupy, the midpalate gains some tannic traction. Raw meat and blackberry flavors mark the juicy finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish. A new classic in every sense, with stellar balance and complexity. Less than 400 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Tannins and red plums combine in this light, elegant wine. The acidity is important though, with the fruit fresh rather than warm.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This epitomizes Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel. It's dry, briary and brambly, with wild berry, cola and crisped bacon flavors. It's incredibly spicy, offering everything from black and white pepper to nutmeg, anise and clove. The texture is a delight\u2014silky and gently tannic. While the official alcohol is 13.7%, it tastes warmer.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Air\u00e9n is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Rather tough and astringent now, with crunchy, dry tannins and acidity dominating. These are very fine vineyards but the vintage was so-so. With its core of cherries, red currants and cola, it could develop over the next six years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Spice and blackcurrant aromas are combined with solid tannins and powerful wood flavors to give a spectacular, polished style, a contrast to the  often rustic wines that come from this appellation. The wine comes from 90-year old vines that are then aged in 70% new wood for 18 months.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Simple, hot and sweet-and-sour, this is not a success.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise. Shows modest peach and pear flavors, with lots of caramelly, toasty oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"There's so much oak on this Pinot Noir, you might think you were tasting a dessert made with vanilla cream and toasted meringue, like the crust on a baked Alaska. Under all that, loads of ripe raspberries and cherries. Shows the excellent hallmarks of a fine Santa Rita Pinot Noir, but certainly is one of the oakier versions.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of white flowers, stone fruits and lees are typical of well-made Albari\u00f1o. A juicy, elegant palate with a mix of citrus and stone-fruit flavors is lasting, with a hint of pithy character coming up on the finish.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Toasty, with a bit of cedar or menthol on the nose; red berries and licorice on the palate. The fruit here is delicate and tart, particularly on the finish, where the flavors are almost lemony.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made in a directly appealing style, this Syrah is soft and slightly sweet. It offers flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and milk chocolate, with notes of anise and tangerine rind. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An elegant, restrained, yet lovely Pinot Noir from a much-maligned vintage. Soft, round cherry fruit is wrapped in sandalwood and mocha flavors. Fully ripe with fine tannins and lovely integration of the barrel notes.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"D'Alessandro's plump Syrah is a bold and generous red wine, with richly layered aromas of cherry, blackberry, rum cake, bacon fat and toasted nut. Pair this wine with abbacchio arrosto (roast lamb).","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"The score reflects the rich cherry, blackberry, cola and smoked meat flavors in this dry, crisp, silky wine. But it also takes into account a certain funkiness and one-dimensional simplicity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very dark espresso, leather and black plum aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is full and balanced by good acidity. The very dry, long finish shows tar, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors, along with some tannins to shed. Time should allow the solid fruit to come from behind the lavish toast that now veils it.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Soft and simple, with candied peach and pear flavors and some oaky, leesy influence that makes it a little fancier.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Pretty good for the price. Dry and fruity, with polished cherry and cassis flavors. Turns a little harsh and minty, but easy to like with pizza, burgers, enchiladas.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine seems barely ripe, with thin, herbal, almost vegetal flavors and a sour streak. The barrel aging may have contributed some suggestions of vanilla and licorice.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A first-class Cabernet, this is dry, richly tannic and mouthwateringly tart in acidity. It shows savory blackberry and cherry flavors, while the oak gives it an umami tang of smoke. Drink now-2016.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fogarty's basic '05 Chard shows an exciting crispness and minerality that, good as it is, makes you long for the single-vineyard bottlings to come. There's an elegant angularity to the wine despite the succulent pineapples, kiwis and new oak, and a brisk acidity that makes it finish vibrantly clean.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine has some good blackberry and oak flavors. But the strong, green hit of vegetable is distracting.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Absolutely easy to drink, a soft, silky wine with pleasantly ripe berry and cherry flavors. Has a rich Asian spiciness throughout, and is dry and balanced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This latest edition of Hekate opens with a bright amber-gold color and shows lively aromas of stone fruit, especially apricot, honey, caramel, almond paste and yellow rose. It tastes thick, sticky and deliciously sweet on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Power characterizes this Bordeaux blend, which is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. It's strong in primary fruit, showcasing blackberries, black cherries, plums, carob and cola, and also strong in tannins, with a brisk, scoury mouthfeel. Add dryness, and you have a young, fresh wine of some charm and limited ageability. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This Zinfandel tastes and feels hot and Port-like. While some people enjoy this style, it feels a bit clumsy and overripe. Nonetheless, the blackberry, raisin and chocolate flavors are tasty.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fruity, soft and candied, this high alcohol wine has blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with a rustic texture. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a few other varieties.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This delivers a very lively and plush quality of ripe blackberry, leather, tobacco, cola and cigar box. The mouthfeel is bold, soft and velvety. Keep this wine in your cellar for five years or more.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"The opening is attractive, with mocha, raspberry and carob scents but it turns a bit tart in the mouth. Rustic tannins provide a backdrop for the char and vanilla flavors of the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Cherry, berry and herb flavors are buried inside bigtime tannins that numb the palate, in this dry, smoothly textured wine. It's questionable whether the wine has enough stuffing for the cellar.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A good Pinot that shows a fine coastal influence. Dry and silky, it displays flavors of ripe cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice and sandalwood, with a cinnamon and pepper flourish. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Medium-intense scents of dark berries and black plum unfold in the bouquet of this wine, with soft hints of vanilla, toast and garrigue in the background. The mouthfeel is robust and gripping, with skin-driven fruit flavors and solid tannins that stay through the finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A big, fat wine that lives up to the popular image of Meursault. Perhaps it could do with a little more depth of flavor, but it's a ripe glassful of Chardonnay now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is a genuine but simple interpretation of Barbera d'Asti Superiore with fresh fruit layers and vibrant tones of cherry, cranberry and pomegranate. This easy-pairing food wine boasts cleansing acidity, medium density and a polished finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Pure Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon fruit brings sexy flavors of wild berry and cassis. This vintage has bright acids and fairly tamed tannins, and the fruit pops out with lovely cherry flavors. Maybe not as concentrated as some past vintages, but beautifully proportioned, accessible and still ageworthy over the medium term.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Parducci's '03 True Grit was a sensation. The '04 is a worthy successor. Dry, tannic and amazingly rich, it floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, currant, leather, coffee, carob and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. Like any great young Petite Sirah, it will age for many years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This full and generous red wine from Umbria is aged 18 months in casks, 18 months in small barrel and 18 months in the bottle before its release. All this to soften the notoriously hard tannins of the Sagrantino grape. That firm structure is still very apparent and the wine ends with cherry, spice, and bold, super-ripe raspberry.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is a nice wine for drinking now. It's very forward in blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, and finishes a little sweet.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This pleasant effort is light and cherry-flavored. It shows little evidence of any barrel flavors despite aging in 100% French oak. The tannins stiffen up and give it a bit of backbone.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a classic California interpretation of a southern Rh\u00f4ne-style blend. It's a good wine, smooth and pleasant if not particularly complex, offering rich flavors of cherry, cherry liqueur, cola, mocha, bacon and white pepper. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"They held this Cab-Sangiovese blend back, but it's still awkward. It's clean and fruity, but way too sugary sweet for a dry table wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A certain creamy nuttiness is suggested on the nose. The sunniness of 2015 is expressed by a generous mirabelle ripeness. The body still is very slight and subtle and all about a graceful texture. There's a lovely touch of lemon freshness on the finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is a bright pink ros\u00e9 with a full bouquet of berry and floral aromas but also a pungent point of chemical or solvent at the back that creates an awkward first impression. The wine is bright, firm and crisp on the palate.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Made from vineyards throughout the village of Serralunga d'Alba, this straightforward wine is still closed. It reveals black cherry, espresso, prune and subtle oak alongside a note of tire rubber. It's still extremely young, with aggressive tannins that dry out the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"An 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this shows a pristine, polished bouquet that's composed of black fruit, rum cake, licorice, tobacco and spice. The ripe fruit and cassis notes on the finish add softness and heft. This is elegant and complex, especially in the mouth.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine comes from Gascony, where the Gascon and his famous beret are inseparable. This blend of mainly Gros Manseng has some herbal character but it also has yellow fruits, and a ripe edge of honey that softens and fills out the crisp green-fruit flavors. Drink now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Firehouse Red is Tamarack's bread-and-butter wine, and rightfully so. Though it's a m\u00e9lange of Cabernet, Syrah, Merlot, Franc, Malbec and more, it pulls itself into focus with spicy, slightly high-toned fruit, bright and herbal. The mix of tart red fruit, nettles and wild herbs bring a lot of complexity to what is essentially a mutt wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This quite tart, young and spicy red pulls sharp and puckery cranberry fruit into focus. It's best enjoyed chilled, and would be a fine option for the base of a wine punch.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Heavy and dull in the mouth. They seemed to have picked the darkest, ripest, softest, plummiest lots, and then plastered the wine with oak. Not bad for a Grenache, but lacks the vibrancy and lift you want from Pinot Noir.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ripe, pure flavors of tropical fruits, Meyer lemons, limes and peaches mark this lovely Chardonnay. New French oak adds luscious notes of buttered toast. With crisp acidity and a clean, spicy finish, it's a beautiful Chard to drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Warm spice and oak tones accent fresh apples and lemons on this full-bodied Chardonnay. It's not subtle with a dense slick of caramel that extends along the midpalate, but a kick of lemon-lime acidity on the finish adds some levity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ripe pink grapefruit flavors dominate this delicious wine. It has minerality as well as some richness, crispened by taut tannins and a citrus aftertaste.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Oddly sweet and medicinal, with sugary apricot and orange soda flavors and deficient acidity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"More familiar and less unusual than prior vintages. This wine deals typical, upright lemon, lime and tropical fruit aromas backed by green apple and lemon-based flavors. With good acidity and an even keel, it is a solid, fresh, dry Albari\u00f1o that should not disappoint. Imported by Grapes of Spain.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The region of Lazio in central Italy is not well-known for its wines, but this well-priced 50-50 blend of Montepulciano and Merlot shows its enological potential. This is a rich and penetrating wine with loads of black fruit and spice.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Dry and succulent, this brings tangy flavors of rhubarb and raspberry into focus. It's made for picnic foods\u2014could anything be better with fried chicken? This is widely available and scores a bullseye if your target is a summer sipper.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Starts off with oaky, jammy aromas of cherries and raspberries, and tastes a little sweet in fruit pastry, with the baked crust. Seems a little one-dimensional, although that dimension is a very delicious one. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Muruve is a label worth watching in Toro. The wines are not as brawny and robust as some, and instead they offer more reserved pleasures. This reserva shows coconut and black plum aromas, with very ripe but structured black fruit flavors. Coffee and vanilla flood the finish, and overall the wine is raring to go now and over the next few years.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Dusty and detailed, this pure Viognier incorporates notes of lemon-pepper; tart, fresh lemon pulp and rind; plus a hint of curry powder. This should make an interesting accompaniment to raw clams or oysters.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% each Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Complex old-vine characteristics emerge in a graceful, lengthy, detailed and subtle wine that weaves together herb, tobacco, olive and brambly berries. Drink now\u20132020.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A little sugar goes a long way. This dessert wine is primarily Ain, with a splash of Muscat and Viognier. It's quite sweet, with apricot, tangerine, peach, honey and dusty spice flavors. This would be a great wine if the flavors were more concentrated.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Considering the reputation of Lynch-Bages as a rich, polished wine, it is not surprising that, in 2003, the team of Jean-Michel Cazes and Daniel Lhose produced a superlatively ripe, opulent wine, one that could almost have come from Napa. But not quite: The fruit is compact and dense, with layers of acidity that speak more of  Bordeaux than California. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Of all the 2012 releases from Mannina, this is the most dense, dark and substantial. Cassis and black cherry fruit is set against a stiff streak of char and coffee, backed with firm, ripe tannins. The length and balance are just right for ripe fruit from young vines.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Delicious and inviting with notes of eucalyptus, chocolate-covered cherries and wild raspberries on the nose. The palate exhibits darker flavors by way of black cherry and plum, fleshing out the solidly structured medium weight mouth. A moderate, evolving finish closes nicely with a kiss of sweet oak.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This Malbec is so dry, tannic and acidic that it's impossible to enjoy it on its own. There's a core of blackberries, but wow, what a tough wine. Decant it for a few hours and try it with barbecue.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"While light-bodied, gentle and intricate, this wine offers plenty of flavor nuances. Cranberry and herb tea aromas mark the nose, while the mouthfeel is at once soothing and tangy, with mulled cherry and clove aromas that slowly emerge and persist on the finish. It's a treat to sip and savor.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Distinctive aromas of beeswax and bee pollen continue with similar flavors, wrapped around tart yellow apple fruit. It's lovely, fragrant and ageworthy, in a high-acid Euro mold, but give it plenty of time to breathe. Decanting is a good idea.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins. It's a fight to the finish\u2014fruit or tannin\u2014and too soon to pick a winner.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A bit unripe, with herb and mint flavors side by side with blackberry and cassis. Shows classic Napa mountain structure of tannins and acids, but the mint reprises on the sharp finish. Not an ager.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Roughly equal parts Grenache, Syrah and Mourv\u00e8dre, this is probably Lirac's top wine at the moment. It's big and rich in the mouth, leaving behind a coating of dark fruit, hints of meaty savoriness, baking spices and softly layered wood.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in. In the mouth, it's an intense ride of rich black cherry and plum. For now it's a little closed on the finish; will likely be better in three years.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"A little sweet, which makes the wine less subtle, this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend has jammy raspberry, cherry and vanilla smoke flavors. The finish is very sweet.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very few wineries got Walla Walla grapes in this freeze year, and even L'Ecole, which owns a piece of the Seven Hills vineyard, had to rely on other sources for many of its wines. But this is 100% Seven Hills Syrah, and it delivers wonderful fruit flavors with layers of citrus and tart berries. A green tea streak cuts through the substantial tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Soft and dense with dark fruit, almost baked fruit flavors, that veer into nuts and vanilla, an easy-drinking Zin blended with a smidge of Zin from the 2009 and 2010 vintages as well as 7% Petite Sirah crafted by a Lodi producer to watch.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Mainly Syrah, with a splash of Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre and Viognier, this polished wine is marked by things that are red: red cherries, red currants and red licorice. It's dry, full bodied and tannic. When you swallow, astrigency remains behind, with the aftertaste of crushed red pepper. Lovely and complex, it's a wine to decant.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The bouquet is marked by a steady stream of bright raspberry, rose, wild berry and bitter almond. It's sassy crispness on the finish should pair well with cheese or mayonnaise-based appetizers.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is an attractive, ready-to-drink wine. Its juicy red fruits are balanced with tannins, offering a dry contrast. The finish is dark, structured and suggestive of the wine's potential for aging.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Light-bodied and lacking in tannin, this is a more traditional Barbera, with attractive mixed berry fruit on the nose, followed by forest floor and graham cracker flavors in the mouth. Drink now.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This Montsant white is oily and oaky on the nose. The palate on this Garnacha Blanca is plump feeling, with decent acidity and full flavors of papaya and melon. This finishes oily in feel, with green notes and scallion flavors. Only 500 cases made.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Crisp white-fruit aromas come with a touch of green grass. It feels regular, with briny lime and tart apple flavors.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This gorgeous wine exhibits beautiful sophistication and austere aromas of elegant spice, candied fruit, licorice and maple syrup. It has aged beautifully thus far and promises a bright future ahead. The mouthfeel is tight and polished with firm tannins and exceptional integrity of fruit.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Good price for a rich, textured Syrah. Shows delicious cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, anise, pepper and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Drink this soft, fruity Syrah now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Wet slate minerality leads the brisk, tightly wound nose. On the palate, the wine is a bit perfumed, at least for how tight the nose is, with elements of crisp apple, pear and a touch of nectarine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"There's sweet dark cherry and plum fruit here, but to get to it you need to give the sulfur on the nose time to blow off. When it does, the wait is worth it. A full, lush mouthfeel caresses your palate, and the finish is dry and even. Decant if drinking now, or wait a year or two.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Comes down on the rustic side, but for the price it's pretty good for a dry Cabernet. Shows the variety's full-bodied fanciness in the blackberry, currant, cocoa and licorice flavors, with a rich steak of vanilla oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aging quickly, this tastes principally of raisins and brown sugar. The tannins are soft and the wine is at or slightly past its peak. Drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A rich Chardonnay, with plenty to offer. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth, with dry flavors of citrus, tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast, and brisk, clean acidity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This range of wines comes from different regions of the southwest. The white comes from Gascony and is typical local blend. It is crisp and fruity with a soft texture from the ripe Colombard. There is a light dancing character to this lively, fruity wine. Drink now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Ultraconcentrated and almost heavy on the nose, but not fully syrupy or leaden. Has a heavy disposition in the mouth, with brown sugar, caramel and other usual suspects making up the flavor profile. Creamy and chunky on the finish. Excellent dessert wine for the price.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This is gorgeous with a delicate but intense bouquet of pressed rose, wet earth, licorice cola and dried berry fruit. The mouthfeel is incredibly long and silky.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A soft, fat, caramel-flavored wine, showing strawberry fruits and a creamy texture. It lacks acidity, leaving a wine that needs to be drunk soon.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"The dryness and low alcohol are praiseworthy, but more challenging are hard tannins and biting acidity. With blackberry and sweet green-herb flavors, it's the opposite of today's ripe cult style, but by no means unattractive.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A good, dry, elegant wine, fully ready to drink now with a nice steak. It's a complex Merlot, with layers of black cherries, licorice, cola and spices, as well as a pleasant touch of smoky oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Rusciano is a blend of Syrah and Nero d'Avola that displays impressive depth and complexity. Aromas of dark fruit, spice, black currant and earthy tobacco build in intensity as the wine evolves in the glass. The finish is smooth and rich.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"With its deep, tart-sweet black-plum aromas and flavors wrapped in a toasty oak blanket, this is an appealing, modern-style Barbera. The grape's native acidity is well tamed, but enough remains to make it a great food match. Has good tannic structure, yet has immediate appeal. Finishes long, dark and handsome.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Generous and rounded, this wine combines the opulence of Volnay with a strongly tannic character coming from the old vines. Together, it's a rich, fruit-filled wine that is backed by a dry core and fragrant red berry acidity. Drink from 2018.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"The aromas seem quite dried out, with notes of fruit leather, medicine cabinet and green herbs. The palate brings more of the same, seeming more advanced than its age might indicate.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Crisp and fruity, this is a classic ros\u00e9. It shows a lightness that comes from the delicately handled fruits, giving gentle berry flavors, bright acidity and a textured aftertaste.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"For fans of grassy, gooseberry-accented wines. Lemon and lime show here, too, with decent acidity. Tiny amounts of Semillon and Chardonnay add dimension. It's fruity and simple, very clean (as you'd expect), a touch sweet and finishes swiftly.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This tasty, toasty red wine is all Sangiovese. The tangy red berry fruit flavors carry highlights of peppery herbs. With some air time the wine smoothes out and rolls into a creamy, mocha-infused finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very ripe and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling cherries and raspberries, with a rich seasoning of cinnamon, brown sugar and cocoa. But it's technically dry, and has a crispness from fine Arroyo Seco acidity. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A pretty wine with aromas of black-cherry liqueur and a dash of espresso, or maybe it's the other way around. Round, full and lushly flavored. The high acidity gives it real bite; in fact, the finish is somewhat bitter because of it. Food will soften it up nicely.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This easy Sangiovese should pair with a pizza or a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. There are mild fruit flavors here, followed by sun-drenched aromas of leather and spice.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"The excellent aromas show the muscle and meat typical of the better Syrahs, and the concentrated palate is a well-crafted blend of brambly berry, pepper, sea salt, cured meat and loam.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched soil, overripe plum, leather and a funky whiff of farmyard. On the palate, notes of game, clove and sage join raw red cherry offset by bracing tannins.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A delicious and interesting white wine, made from a variety more usually used for blending purposes. It's honey-rich but dry, similar in structure to an oaky Chardonnay, with tropical fruit and vanilla flavors that have a pleasant touch of bitterness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a bright and fruit-forward red wine from Piedmont in Northern Italy that exhibits prominent, but not overly intense or intrusive, aromas of fresh fruit, exotic spice and drying mineral. The wine has a fresh acidic component balanced by a jammy, sweet finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Simple and seemingly sweet, this Chardonnay has apricot jam flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"With too much oak and too sweet fruit, the result is an unbalanced Chardonnay. It tastes like LifeSaver lemon candies cooked into a baked Alaska dessert.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Firm and muscular, this delivers powerful, concentrated red currant, cherry and berry fruit, tightly wrapped and resonant. Young and compact, the wine just begins to hint at the complexity it contains, with notes of herb, leaf and barrel spice. Good weight and concentration, plus exceptional length and precision.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very ripe, with sun-enriched blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, and rich in sweet, dusty tannins. The finish on this polished, gentle Cab is a little sweet and oaky. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together. Give it until 2012, and it should develop bottle complexity for another 5\u20136 years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is bizarrely perfumed: It tastes like a candy shop smells, with a note of fruit jelly. The tannins are taut, but the wine doesn't hang together.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This wine in a box is simple and direct, with pineapple, lime and peach flavors that are sugary sweet. But it's crisp and clean in acidity, and the box is the equivalent of four regular bottles.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aged in American oak, with mostly similar vineyard sources. The American oak, with more spice to the fruit, and less smoothness overall than the C'est Belle Bottling. Cherry and berry flavors abound; it's sturdy, solid and well-made. Just 170 cases produced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The complexities of Burgundy! This is the vineyard next to the more familiar Les Charmes, just up the slope\u2014hence dessus, meaning above. This vineyard gives a mineral character, hinting at Chablis, but with some Meursault richness as well. Hold this wine, with its delicious vanilla flavors, and it will be ready in a year.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Porty and dull. Almost undrinkable, except for some decent berry and currant flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Smells like ripe peaches with hints of anise and almond. Tastes similar, with a plump mouthfeel that carries the flavors across the palate to a short but pleasant finish. Nice as an ap\u00e9ritif, or with mildly flavored fish or poultry.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of Alicante and Petit Verdot that render a soapy, herbal nose with accents of root beer, exotic spice, lavender potpourri and green pepper corn. It is very well balanced.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Very dry and fairly tannic, it's severe on first sip and hard to appreciate, although there are some good black cherry, cola, leather, oak and black pepper flavors. It's complex in its own way, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Give it a good, long decanting, and drink it now through 2018. The blend is Mourv\u00e8dre, Grenache, Syrah and Counoise, in that order.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"A wonderfully dry, minerally Sauvignon Blanc. It's set off by crisp acidity, and has rewarding flavors of lemons, grapefruits and limes, enriched with pineapples, figs and honeysuckle.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Firm, a bit astringent and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, black cherries and cedar. A solid Cabernet with some raw edges that might age out in a few years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Dripping in earth, kir and fresh raspberry, this is a stellar wine from the heart of the appellation, estate-grown from a four-acre spot planted to a trio of clones. Spirited and refreshing, it dances in acidity and a floral back note that's compelling, wrapped in cinnamon and mocha.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Has all the hallmarks of Viognier, namely lots of tropical fruit, wildflower, vanilla and spicy aromas and flavors, and finishes thoroughly dry. Could use more brightness and zest, though, as it's a bit flat.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Smokey tones of charcoal and dark granite or slate rise from the nose of this Lazio-based Petit Verdot. Dusty mineral notes are followed by dark, ripe fruit and the wine is long-lasting and penetrating on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Kind of tough in the mouth at this time, with aggressive tannins that effectively bury the blackberry flavors. There's also a streak of hung meat or smoky leather that adds dimension. Best to let it soften for a few years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a difficult wine to understand, with a very specific philosophy behind it. Light, elegant and ethereal, the 60-40 blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato is aged in terracotta amphorae in a studied attempt to present as pure a product as nature allows. It offers loads of bright fruit, wild berries, earth, spice and impressive complexity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Here's an oak-aged Chardonnay from northern Italy that offers the bright intensity of peach, melon and yellow flower backed by the elegance of toast and roasted nut. The wine is creamy and soft in the mouth with some bitter almond notes on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Defines a style entirely separate from Napa's. Has those rustic Dry Creek tannins and even a briary edge to the blackberries and cherries, and is totally dry. Well-made and elegant.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Smooth and ripe smelling, with clean berry aromas. Cherry, plum and pepper are the lead flavors, and the feel is tangy, zippy and clampy, but exceedingly fresh. Not a lot of richness, depth or body here, but it's pure, clean wine with common appeal.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Just a single barrel was made, pure Sangiovese from the Candy Mountain Vineyard. Tight, tart and dark, it captures black cherry fruit with black licorice and a whiff of smoke. At this point in time the tannins and acids seem to be fighting it out for control.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Something like a cross between a silky Pinot Noir and a soft Merlot, this is a gentle, fruity wine, with berry, tobacco, cola and spice flavors. A nice scour of tannins suggests this will pair with rich, oily meats and cheeses.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Simple cherry fruit, with a delicately earthy base, defines this everyday Merlot. It keeps its herbal component in check, balanced appropriately against rather light fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Date and tar notes come nuanced with a funky, sweat-like aroma. The palate feels lax on attack, and it tastes a bit thin on flavor. Firm, upper-lip-grabbing tannins mark the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"It's certainly tannic and tough at the moment, the wine also has so much fruit. That will allow it to round out, bringing out the black currant fruitiness and resulting in a full, rich and perfumed wine. Wait until 2018.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Crisp and refreshing with notes of grated ginger, white flowers and cantaloupe. This dry Riesling balances peachy fruit flavors with a steely backbone of slate and lime, tart acidity and a pleasantly long finish. Lovely all around.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is light and generic, the sort of low-priced Merlot that California cranks out by the boatload. Washington can do better. There's a spiffy new label, but where's the beef?","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Intense blueberry and blackberry notes penetrate through this fruity, forward Pinot Noir. Hints of savory herbs add elegance to an otherwise one-dimensional palate that finishes with big, coarse tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Easy to like for its crisp, mouthwatering acidity and flavors of lemons and limes, figs and vanilla. A nice, everyday wine to drink with roast chicken or as a cocktail sipper.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"With its tobacco and fresh raspberry aromas, this is a light, perfumed, smoky wine of fragrant Cabernet Franc with a touch of blueberry tannins and an intense burst of finishing acidity.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"The Chelan region is Washington's newest AVA, but already showing great potential for Syrah, as this aromatic and explosively flavorful bottle proves. Ripe berries, plums and cherries are swept into a mix of smoke and rock and iron filings; as you taste through the wine there are citrusy acids and hints of resin and tar; it just keeps adding in the nuances.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Well structured, balanced, giving tannins as well as acidity to balance fruit that moves in the direction of sweet plums, with hints of coffee and vanilla spice. The wine has a texture that promises aging, but also has a delicious juicy character.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Huge flavors of jammy blackberries and cherries dominate this Syrah, with a coating of sweet, caramelized oak. It's yummy, but not especially complex. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Thick and soft, this wine has simple, sweetish medicinal flavors of cherry and black raspberry Lifesavers. The oak just adds vanilla.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ripeness is both this wine's blessing and its challenge. It's super-fruit in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants and cherries, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. But it's all on the surface, without much complexity. So drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lush concentration and deep aromas of dark fruit and black cherry make an excellent first impression. This Dolcetto shows a dark, deep color and a chewy, almost inky texture.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A very nice Chardonnay that has the dusty, herbal tug that Napa Chards often display. Otherwise it's very rich, with potent pineapple pie and peach tart flavors, enriched with creamy lees and buttery new oak. Drink now\u20132012.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lightweight and thin in the mouth, this zesty white wine does a good job of keeping your palate refreshed and quenches your thirst (think hot summer day). It's an easy and informal wine that stays focused on simplicity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Old vines have produced a superconcentrated and ripe wine. It has notes of toast, spice and yellow fruit as well as bright acidity. With its structure, depth of flavor and density, it should age well over 3\u20134 years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"The nose of this blend of 58% Syrah, 17% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot, 8% Malbec and 8% Petite Sirah is a touch funky, with sour blackberry, charcoal and dried meat aromas. Charred blueberry, sour black plum and savory meat flavors show on the palate.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Soft and sweetly fruity, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, plums and cherries, spiced with anise and cinnamon. Easy to like. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"If you know the Rh\u00f4ne-style wines of Saxum, which is probably Paso Robles' most expensive wine, this is nearly identical. Mostly Syrah, with 8% Grenache, the wine is decadently rich in milk chocolate, blackberry jam and sweet, smoky oak flavors. It's very high in alcohol, but unless you're an extremist in this regard, you can't help but be knocked out by the wine's sensuous pleasures.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A bit on the soft, overripe side, with currant, licorice, cherry, cocoa and oak flavors. But it's dry, and the tannins are fancy. Drink it fresh out of the bottle with a grilled steak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This beautiful wine further confirms the high level of quality in the Pinot Noirs from Dan Goldfield and Steve Dutton. It has a profusion of ripe black cherry and currant flavors, backed by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins, giving it grip. Its balance of concentrated fruit flavors and solid structure indicates a long life in the cellar. Best after 2020.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very rich, with bounteous flavors of crushed ripe blackberries, blueberries, dill, black pepper and dark chocolate, with firm, furry tannins. A bit bitter now, and might age for a couple years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of vanilla and wood spice lead to elegant, somewhat dried out and dilute fruit flavors, followed by a short finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A collaboration between Sonoma County-based winemaker Jesse Katz and Ken Forrester of South Africa, this 100% varietal red is robust and rich. Dark cherry, red currant and integrated oak flavors support its bold body.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An extraordinarily rich Pinot, fat and opulent in cherry compote, mocha and root beer flavors. Generously oaked, it offers spicy oak notes and a velvety texture. It's a big, fruit-forward wine, but manages to maintain delicacy and harmony throughout. Best now through 2008.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Relatively tight and closed up at this stage, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in 5 years time\u2014it will be magnificent.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is a Pinot Noir-based blend, and it's quite a good dry, red wine of some sophistication and elegance. Soft and approachable, its cherry fruit flavors are complexed with herbs, such as sage and thyme, and a rich earthiness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An easy drinking dinner wine, dry and balanced, with smooth tannins and plum, blackberry and coffee flavors. Has a rich, blueberry-muffin taste on the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Catches your eye with its brassy hue, and also makes its mark with an overtly sweet nose of peach blossom and melon. In the mouth, however, it struggles a bit, offering cider and melon flavors on a soft, rather punchless palate.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This is cool on the nose, with tree bark and tobacco aromas that come together well. Tannic and stout, it's not punishing, with a roasted black-fruit flavor and a backing of espresso bitterness. This shows a syrupy side and also raw power. Drink now\u20132018.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"A beautifully executed wine, this has fine aromas of cola, red currant, licorice, blue flower and moist earth. The texture is long, smooth, silky and elegant texture. There's a touch of menthol on the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very, very sweet in residual sugar, with powerful flavors of apricots, honey, oranges and vanilla. A bit soft, but the luscious sweetness is what makes it work.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Mild peachy aromas are friendly but nothing serious or intense. This varietal Macabeo feels citrusy, while lightly bitter flavors of almond skins, citrus pith and green melon finish with simplicity and a note of nectarine.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Ame means the spirit, the soul, and Alain Rotier believes this wine expresses the true nature of his Gaillac estate. On that basis, it's a place of great perfumes, coming through in the wine from wood as well as chunky black fruits. It is a relatively soft wine, the concentration in the dense fruit rather than the tannins.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is bone dry, with plenty of acidity and tough tannins. It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue. But you have to consider its origin in Yountville, a cool area noted for ageable wines. It hould begin to resolve its difficulties by 2016.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Packaged in a modern screwcap bottle, this friendly blend of Ribolla Gialla with smaller percentages of Friulano and Riesling delivers a bright golden color and lively fruit aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is crisp and lively in the mouth and perfectly captures the spirit of winemaking in Northeast Italy.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A bit raw and rustic in texture, with a briary, green peppercorn mouthfeel that's scoury and tart in acids. Couple that with berry-cherry fruit, and you can a Zin that tastes sweet-and-sour. But it's very Zinny, and will wash down barbecue with ease.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Will appeal broadly to many Pinot lovers for its soft, lush array of flavor. Raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice and bacon all lead to a long, spicy finish. Trades complexity for immediate appeal, so drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Too heavy and soft, like a melted mocha-raspberry sundae. Lacks structure, which makes it taste too sweet.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Birch Creek Vineyard provides the fruit for this stainless-steel-fermented and aged wine. It offers notes of custard, lees and herbs. The clover flavors show a richer feel but the concentration doesn't all seem to be there, trailing toward the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Almost stewy but not totally over the top. The nose offers more earth and oak than brightness, while the palate is herb-infused, with berry and tomato. Fairly classic in style, but not as fresh as desirable.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Very dry and a little earthy, with a dusty hay or dried straw quality to the tangerine, sweet lime, lychee, peaches and cream flavors. An interesting, crisp Chard with plenty of nuanced complexity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Smells and tastes ungenerous, probably due to unripe grapes that give an earthy, vegetal taste to the wine. Not going anywhere, so drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Nice, rugged mountain Zin, with the briary, brambly tannins and peppery taste of wild berries freshly picked off the vine. Alcohol adds heat and structure, and time in the barrel has softened the tannins. This might just be the perfect backyard barbecue red wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Moody, complex and brooding, this is a superb wine and an exceptional value. Purple violets, black forest cake, cocoa nibs and espresso granules all abound on the nose, backed by dark juicy black raspberries. Full and firmly structured in the mouth with notes of pepper, tea, smoked meat and black fruit on the palate.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Pened\u00e8s? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it. The nose is meaty, ripe and round, while the palate features pure core fruit backed by chocolaty warmth. With kick as well as subtlety, this is a bargain hunter's dream. Imported by Grapes of Spain.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Another good job at a relatively inexpensive white variety from Clos du Bois. With Lake and Sonoma county grapes, the wine shows good Sauvignon Blanc character. Dry and crisp, it's savory in lemongrass, grapefruit and peach flavors that are lightly oaked.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A touch of oak influence lends smokiness to the lime, Meyer lemon and tropical fruit flavors. With its crisp acidity that creates a sweet-and-sour taste, this wine is for drinking now as a cocktail sipper or with ham or Chinese food.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A very tasty wine, loaded with fleshy, fruity flavor. The dominant note is fresh cut pear, dappled with cinnamon spice. Round and balanced, it's a delicious bottle with just a slight hint of residual sweetness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Nice aromas of pie crust, red fruit and some barnyard lead to a tart, simple wine with watered-down flavors of red berry.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a bold, densely structured wine with vanilla-cream, orange-soda and pineapple-custard flavors. There's good acidity, but it appeals to the modern style with it's ripe, straightforward feel.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Another lovely Gewurz from Navarro. Made with neutral oak fermentation, it's rich and crisp and spicy, with a m\u00e9lange of exotic fruit and wildflower flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"With off-dry flavors of ripe lemons, limes and vanilla, accented with brisk acidity, this simple wine will pair well with sweet Chinese and Vietnamese foods, and the price is right.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A pretty good Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, with crisp acidity and a backbone of tannins. The flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit are delicious, but the texture is scoury and a little warm, even though the alcohol is relatively low.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Polished and sophisticated, with lush green apple, pineapple, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors. Likeable for its balance and sheer drinkability.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From young vintner Giovanni Abrigo in the Treiso area, this is a lovely expression of Barbaresco with immediate aromas of cherry, cassis, spice, smoke, leather and tobacco. The wine is approachable now, but it's also built to last: natural concentration, bright fruit flavors and acidity will hold ten years or more.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Rooty and earthy smelling, this has aromas of leather, cassis, tobacco, dried cheese and cola. It feels rich and nicely textured, with firm but friendly tannins that set up tobacco, coffee, mocha and roasted berry flavors. It's chocolaty in an uncanny way on the finish. Drink now through 2018.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Without a doubt one of the most successful vineyard crus in Barbaresco, Rabaj\u00e0 delivers unique intensity and sophistication. You'll notice aromas of black fruit, spice, tar and licorice and there's good balance between the wine's acidity and its tannic structure. Pair this wine with roasted pork stuffed with prunes.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Michel Laroche has been branching out of Chablis in recent years and his southern French effort has some chlorine notes along with aromas of mint and sweet wood. The power is up there, but there isn't suppleness to match. The palate pulsates while the finish is dark and sharp, with a burnt flavor.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Like almost all of Reverie's Cabernets on release, this one needs time in the cellar. Tasted in fall 2011, it's tight and grapey, with blackberry jam flavors girded by a firm, stony minerality and sweet, but hard, tannins. Give it 6\u20138 years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This pure Mourv\u00e8dre begins well, offering a full palate of varietal flavors that are built upon a mix of citrus and ripe tree fruits, along with accents of leaf and forest. It turns soft and seems a bit overripe, running into a rather short finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a bone-dry, crisply acidic and ultraclean Sauvignon Blanc. Its lemongrass, lime and grapefruit flavors are savory and bright, and accented with a cold streak of stony minerals.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a simple and fruity Nero d'Avola that offers fleeting blackberry and tart red-cherry flavors alongside fresh acidity. Pair this with pizza or with other everyday, informal meals.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A sub-brand of Riunite, Albinea Canali's Ottocentonero shows simple, easy lines with raw fruit, cherry and almond paste. It's a dry Lambrusco without some of the bitterness you sometimes encounter with these wines.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"When this bottling is from a ripe vintage, it can be quite good. But the cool 2007 harvest has yielded a somewhat green wine. It has grapefruit and gooseberry flavors that veer into feline territory.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The aromas of lemon, soil and flowers are quite subdued. The flavors are restrained with impressive balance and the variety's often burly tannins well tamed.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Coming from such a cool climate, this Cab isn't as opulent or ripe as, say, Napa. There's a wintergreen mint note alongside the sweet red cherry and black raspberry flavors, and a lightly elegant weight. It's a different kind of Cab, but a dry, good one, and very friendly with food.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lots of ripe, jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate fruit in this easy-drinking Cab. Shows some rusticity, though, in the raisiny finish and astringency of the tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"With aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Sangiovese with 25% Merlot for added softness and dimension, this wine boasts pretty notes of cherry, blue flowers, toasted almonds and exotic spice. It has nice elegance overall but is a bit compact in the mouth.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This luminous Pinot Grigio opens with simple aromas of stone fruit, melon and citrus and delivers fine levels of acidity and enough structure to carry forward with fish pasta or risotto. The wine performs nicely in the mouth thanks to its creamy texture.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"The most tannic and closed of Vine Cliff's magnificent array of '07 Cabernets. It's hard, with a bite of acidity, but it doesn't take much for the richness to explode. Blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, butterscotch, sweet cinnamon spice, the list goes on and on. So rich and decadent, you can enjoy it now, but it will gather momentum over the next 6\u20138 years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Mild salinic aromas bring lime and lychee. Feels standard and smooth enough, with sweet white fruit flavors that suggest peach. As a semi-dry, it always feels and tastes sugary.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"With 14 months' new wood aging, this wine is still all wood and toast. The wine does have weight, with the promise of blackberry fruits under the firm tannins. It is finely structured and should mature well.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Erath's fresh and lightly fruity Pinot Gris is a bit more substantial than this new Pinot Blanc. Soft and fruity, this is a simple wine which does not challenge the palate in any way. All stainless steel fermented, it is the quintessential quaffer.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Winemaker Denis Malbec has created a brilliantly delicious, crisp, dry yet richly textured version of the variety that opens with golden honey, dried apricot and lychee on the nose and mouth. Very minerally, the wine has a steely finish with smoky, oaky edges.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A hearty Cabernet rich in cranberry and cassis with streaks of earthy cedar and a pleasant herbal undertone. The tannins are young still, pleading to wait until 2017\u20132019 in the bottle, or for some air before enjoying.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Curiously perfumed with notes of roasted hazelnuts and fresh apples, this is a savory, dry Chardonnay. Full bodied in style with notes of nut oil and nut skins throughout, it ends with a hint of wood sap astringency on the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"A pale pink color introduces this wine, as do fairly weak aromas of bubble gum and freshly squeezed lime. This is one of three ros\u00e9s made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate. It would be a great match for anything rich in texture but light in flavor, as it could be easily overwhelmed.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"For any serious fan of Rivesaltes, this is a must-have example. Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced\u2014sweet and heady without being cloying. All of the aromas transition onto the palate alongside accents of walnut skins and shiitake mushroom. Soft salinity makes the long finish even more mouthwatering. Drink now, or continue to age. There are 869 bottles produced.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Epineuil is a region between Burgundy and Chablis, producing light, fruity Pinot Noir. This perfumed and dusty wine does show some firm tannins. It is bright with red currant and raspberry fruits, with a fresh aftertaste.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This 12-year old shows signs of maturity, but retains freshness and liveliness as well. With its yeasty edge, toasty flavors and wonderful white fruits all in balance, it is finely balanced. The acidity is kept in check by the richness of the mature fruit. A very complete Champagne.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"You sure can taste the sunny, fruity extract in this wine. It's massive in black cherry liqueur, cassis and mocha-choca flavors. It's also very soft, with a long, almost sweet finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"and sweet, with candied cherry, raspberry and carob flavors. Tasty enough, but seriously lacks the acidity to make this fruity wine come alive. From Cartlidge & Browne.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Just like the '07, this is a blend of 60% Grenache Bl;anc, 20% Marsanne and 20% Roussanne, featuring ripe melon and peach fruit wrapped around an underlying minerality. It's full and broad, yet manages to be refreshing despite its weightiness.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"An intensely mineral expression of Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, full of citrus flavors, deliciously fresh, but also complex. The wine is concentrated into a steel spring of ripeness, ready to burst from the glass.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is grandiose, with ripe apricot and peach flavors\u2014even a note of mango\u2014that are allied to the wood notes. As a contrast, there is fine acidity and elegance, with a lemon zest edge that gives structure to this full, superripe, powerful effort.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This hearty red wine from central Italy would pair well with grilled meat or veal wrapped in sage leaves and sliced prosciutto ham. Loads of red berries are followed by notes of exotic spice, leather, tobacco and firm tannins. Drink in 3\u20135 more years.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"From Dijon clones, this sculpted, tight, compact Chardonnay feels as if it is shut in a cocoon. Give it time (and decanting) to unwrap, and it shows elegant tropical and stone fruits, caramel, vanilla cream and butter flavors, backed with moderate acids.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This debut blend somehow reaches 15% alcohol, not easy to do with Yakima Valley Sangiovese. It's a solid effort, which opens well\u2014supple and polished, with pretty flavors of mixed plum and berry. It's silky, smooth and there's plenty of tangy fruit. The finish gets a little too hot, but that's a minor quibble in a wine that gives you this much flavor at this price. The finish keeps getting more and more interesting, piling on smoked ham and spicy clove as it goes.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Texture is the name of the game here. We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6\u20138 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a terrific value wine (a ros\u00e9 made from the indigenous grapes of Sicily) that opens with a bright pink color and fragrant tones of raspberry, white almond and rose petal.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Light strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry fruit, medium weight, straight-ahead, nicely ripened. The tannins are soft and the balance works just fine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The year 2007 is not going to go down in the books as a good one for Ribera del Duero. Many of the young wines, like this one, are showing narrow, sour fruit and too much funk and pickle. Here, there's a touch of jamminess and red fruit but mostly it's another thin, pushy wine with anemic flavors and a rough mouthfeel. Stick with the 2006 if you can find it.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Some years ago, Willamette Valley Vineyards purchased the Tualatin Estate vineyards and winery founded by Bill Fuller in 1973. To mark the return of Mr. Fuller to winemaking, the new cuv\u00e9e celebrates his 40th vintage. A tawny gold, it's scented with honeycomb and pineapple. Potent and focused, it carries those flavors into a finish rich with bee pollen and preserved lemon intensity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fattoria Scopone's 2004 Riserva opens with charred aromas of campfire, liquid smoke and barbecue sauce. The fresh fruit notes tend to be on the ripe side: think mature cherry and strawberry. In the mouth, however, this well-crafted wine is smooth, silky and long lasting.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Lean, sharp and herbal, this is a true ap\u00e9ritif wine that whets the appetite. A slight sour-cream note on the palate is offset by a tangy citrus-laden finish that blends in some cinnamon-spiced pear flavors.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"For eight bucks you get a rich, creamy taste of pineapples, green apples and cinnamon spice. Not quite sweet, not quite dry, but balanced with crisp acidity. A bargain.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"There is no lack of oak barrel scents and accents here\u2014chocolate and toast, layered around light strawberry fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fresh, crisp and fruity, this is a good light ros\u00e9 that could be a fine alternative to a red wine for a turkey or ham dinner. The finish is clean, round and flavored with red berry fruits.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Morellino di Scansano is known in Italy as an informal, fruit-forward wine that washes down beautifully with heaping plates of pasta and home cooked meals. This expression follows squarely in that tradition and offers perky aromas of cherry cola, spice, blackberry and dried Mediterranean herbs.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Cola-like in flavor, with earthier notes of tobacco and leather. Drinks pretty lean, and the tannins are strong. Finshes with a bitterness of acids and tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The winery identifies this as \u201cthe best barrels from our best lots.\u201d Supple and streaked with chocolate and caramel, this explosion of cherry, cassis, cola and Dr. Pepper contains sneaky notes of tobacco and pepper threaded through the lingering finish. Richness and depth prevail throughout.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"I have seldom tasted a Dry Creek Valley Cabernet (the appellation, not the winery) that didn't have a woolly edge to it. This wine is an excellent example. It's briary, with pushy tannins and the succulent flavor of wild blackberries. Oak adds a sheen of vanilla and smoke.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This riserva opens with a textured, granular mouthfeel that is packed tight with leather, tobacco, dried berry and cola flavors. The close is fresh and menthol-driven.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple cr\u00e9me brul\u00e9e, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Light berry fruit, alcohol around 13%, a pale color, and plenty of acidity characterize this Pinot Noir. Still tightly wound, it may add some flesh with further bottle age. The aromas hint at tomato leaf, and the wine fades gently.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Another successful 2011 from this winery, in fact the best of their six new Pinots. Shows the brilliant acidity and light, delicate texture of the coast, with the concentrated fruit, cola and spice flavors this esteemed vineyard is noted for. Highly complex and dry, it's delicious to drink now, and should age well for a good six years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Tastes as heavy and sugary sweet as cherry pie filling without the crust, lacking structural integrity and dryness. Does not help the reputation of the vineyard.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The '04 Reserve Cab Franc was a very good wine. This one is much different, rustic and simple, with stewed cherry flavors and a bitter finish. Okay for everyday fare.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Quite tart when it hits the lips, this is nonetheless a dense, flavorful Pinot Gris, tasting of grapefruit, sour orange, apple and green banana. It shows lots of juice and powers through the mid-palate into a fruit-driven finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Violet, plum, leather and baking spice aromas merge on this easygoing red. The no-fuss palate offers black cherry, star anise and a hint of clove alongside polished but rather fleeting tannins. Drink soon.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Bone dry, but sharp and harsh in texture, with some minty flavors next to the black cherries. Okay for an everyday sipper with casual foods.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a well-structured juicy, fruity wine. Aromas of redcurrants, and flavors of fresh black fruits, are balanced by firm, dry tannins and some acidity.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Plum and black cherry fruit flavors are at the core of this warmly generous wine, a round mouthful of fruit and sweet baking spices.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is quite flavorful, with apples, pears and peaches equally in the mix. The fruit is front and center, and the wine has unusual polish for its price. It keeps coming on through a surprisingly long finish, with nicely structured skin and rind flavors wrapping up the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Malpelo is a ramato-style Pinot Grigio (which means it sports a copperish color) with a cool glass closure that has done a good job of locking in the wine's fresh fragrances of citrus, rose, peach and white spice. Pair this wine with tuna steak or raw salmon tartar.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Here's a winery founded at the start of the 1900s that has morphed over the decades to enthusiastically embrace modern use of oak. In fact, the wood here is almost too much of a good thing with carpentry and cedar notes that mask much of the cherry fruit. In the mouth, it has a chewy texture, smoke favors and a spice-driven finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A berry scented wine that's loaded with fresh mint aromas and accented by toasty oak.  The tannins are ripe and soft; the acidity bright.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Made from four Rh\u00f4ne varieties dominated by Mourv\u00e8dre and Syrah, but this blend is solidly warm-climate California. Bursts with jammy cherry, blackberry and spice flavors that finish a little sweet and simple.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This contains a fairly high proportion (10\u201315%) of Viognier, but still seems more tightly packed than Faury's 100% Syrah Saint-Joseph. It's riper, with more cherry-berry fruit and less meatiness, but still has great floral aromas and hints of pepper on the finish. Drink now\u20132015.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Here's an elegant expression of Cabernet Sauvignon with smooth aromas of wild berries and cherry that are seamlessly integrated with light shadings of spice and toast. The wine is crisp and generous on the palate and delivers a smooth, but determined texture.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Apparently made from Bordeaux varieties, this wine is crisp and overtly sweet. It has simple, jammy flavors of pineapples, lemons and limes.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Ouch. Tough, extremely dry, and acidic-tannic, this wine isn't showing much charm now. There's a suggestion of blackberry, bitter cherry and blueberry fruit, as well as lots of smoky oak. Nowhere near ready, and hard to predict. Try after 2008.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Talcum powder, orange peel and a bit of fresh-cut grass make for a pleasant bouquet. Quite forward and fully charged on the palate; there's melon, apple and lemon as well as some softer peach flavors. Good and lively. Imported by Vineyard Brands.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. The aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, cherry and spice are subdued while the palate brings a somewhat elegant style, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Starts off with melon and a touch of almond character, then adds brighter pineapple notes that turn tart and metallic on the finish, a poignant counter to the wine's breadth on the palate.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Relatively low in alcohol (12.2% is the listing), this is thin on fruit but does offer soft flavors of yeasty bread dough, along with some stemmy tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The '04 was so much better, maybe because of vintage or sourcing differences. This is sharp in green, minty tastes, and the cherry and cola flavors finish simple and thin. Earns an extra point for a rich spiciness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah has a lot of heat and power locked within, recognized by slightly cooked or jammy fruit notes. But you'll also get very pleasant, warm tones of soft leather and sweet pipe tobacco.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine is very extracted and jammy, in the modern style of extreme ripeness and fruit-forwardness. Sweet oak, 70% of it new, adds layers of cream, vanilla and buttered toast. Appeals now for its juicy, New World style.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Shows very ripe black currant flavors that veer into raisins and prunes, while the smoky oak adds a caramelized layer that makes the wine taste Port-like. But it's dry, with crisp acids.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Light red fruits, perhaps just a little stewed and herbal, with a soft mouthfeel and mocha-streaked finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Flavors of creamy vanilla pudding, buttered toast and pineapple jam mark this slightly sweet Chardonnay. A crisp streak of acidity provides much needed balance to the richness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A rich Riesling, just off dry, balancing intense acidity with white currant, hedgerow fruits and a concentrated texture. The wine is full-bodied, very ripe and superbly structured. Very fruity now, this is a wine to show how well Riesling can age\u2014give it 6\u20138 years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Our unanimous favorite of the tasting, La Prima comes from the oldest vines on the property, and is a blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino aged in barriques. Dark color, with black plums and hints of violets on the nose, the oak is understated, allowing the blackberry, plum and floral notes to shine through. Finishes rich, chewy and long.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Made with southern Italy's most noble white grape, this structured wine conveys subtle aromas of white and yellow spring flowers accented by whiffs of beeswax and slate. The juicy palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit and mineral alongside fresh acidity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Made by Carabella, this popular budget Pinot sports solid, country flavors. Plenty of bright, vivid and tart fruit\u2014berries and cherries\u2014give it a full-bodied, forward expression. But it's not all front-loaded; there is surprising depth, and overall a fine balance.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a young, tight wine. It stuns with strong acidity and a bitter lime zest, almost gooseberry tartness. But it's nobly structured, and badly in need of a year or two in the cellar, or extended decanting. Oxygen and warming up bring out exciting notes of tropical fruits, buttercream and oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this robust wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature plum, toast and roasted coffee bean. The palate offers prune, dried cherry, black pepper, graphite and espresso alongside dusty tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the midpalate.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Full of juicy red-fruit flavors, this is hugely rich. It is solid, chunky and concentrated, with jammy red-plum flavors marrying with firm tannins and intense acids. Expect this wine to age for six-plus years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"The '05, as befits a cool vintage, is lean, with the alcohol showing through bare-bones citrus flavors. Even those who like their whites dry and flinty may find this Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier blend a little thin.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A solid wine, with plum skin and dry tannin textures. It does have the ripe fruit of 2009, attractive red fruits and juicy acidity. But it needs aging over at least three years to show its fruitiness.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"The wine's tan-gold color tells you that it's fading, the aromas of canned pineapple are not particularly fresh, and the finish is fleshy and fat. Imported by Alconde Vineyards, LLC.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"From the Lonesome Spring Ranch vineyard, this is very fresh, with juicy citrus and orange peel flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A rich, soft, oaky Cabernet, forward and appealing in blackberry and cherry jam, cassis, mocha and olive flavors. Shows the class and distinction of the vineyard sources in Napa and Sonoma.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The '07 release of this wine, a blend of four considerable vineyards, was great. This 2008 is less so, although it's still a fine wine. Packed with cherry, cola and spice flavors, it's a little raw in the mouth. Decant for a few hours before drinking.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is Goldeneye's basic appellation Pinot. It's fairly rich in cherries, raspberries, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood, with an elegantly crisp mouthfeel. But it lacks excitement, especially at this price. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An easy to like Syrah, soft and gentle, with raspberry, cherry, spice, tobacco, herb and smoke flavors. Defines the warm-climate, lighter style of Paso Robles Syrah.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This offers appealing notes of cranberry, cherry and orange peel along with a kiss of vanilla. It's tart and fresh in style with puckering fruit flavors\u2014perfect for the dinner table.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"For a Petit Chablis, this is serious and complex, with delicious ripe green and yellow fruits; there is a touch of caramel with toast just at the edge.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Dull and watery. Not much going on beyond the alcohol, although you'll find very modest citrus flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fresh crispness is what you notice first in this luminous and bright Soave. Made from Garganega grapes, the wine boasts aromas of lemon zest, white mineral and pear.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Great price for a brut this classically structured. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's dry and crisp, with a fine mousse that gives it a creamy smooth mouthfeel. The pineapple, raspberry and vanilla flavors are delicious.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Reflecting the heat of the vintage, aromas recall stewed prune, fig and toasted oak. The hearty but one-dimensional palate delivers dried berry, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and anisette alongside raspy, mouth-puckering tannins. Searing alcohol dominates the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Really charming, with a nose of green plums, red berries and earth that jumps out of the glass and curls up in your lap. The palate is lacking a bit in intensity but makes up for it with iresistable cassis flavor followed by fresh-roasted coffee. The bracing acidity would be well matched by a cheese-laden dish such as lasagna. Drink now to one year.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Made in a softly appealing style, this Pinot is like cherry pie sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. It shows Pinot Noir's silky texture.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Without showing the richness of prior vintages, this year's bottling is earthy and crisp and very dry. It has a steely minerality and modest fruit that suggests green apples and pineapples.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A bit vegetal, and a bit sweet on the finish in pineapple candy. Not particularly successful.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Starts out very light in mouthfeel, almost delicately simple, with such a dry, wispy texture that it feels almost inconsequential. Then you notice the flavors of cola, tart cherryskin, ripe rhubarb, coffee, Asian spices and caramelized oak. They mingle together in a complex swirl that makes you want another sip.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Pungent and grapey, with notes of violets and dusty chocolate. The astringent fruit shows varietal cassis flavor, somewhat overtaken by the extremely charred, coffee ground flavors of the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This Pinot opens with aromas of strawberry, cherry and flowers, leading into juicy berry flavors and a touch of balsamic, pepper and strawberry. Good structure and a lingering finish give it added appeal.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Greenwood Ridge often does a good job at Sauvignon Blanc, but not this year. The wine is irritating in unripe feline flavors and it's also off-dry, with 1.9% residual sugar.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Size marks this wine. It's huge in flavor, swamping the palate with black and red cherries, pomegranates, sweet rhubarb pie, coffee and vanilla. At the same time, it's fairly light in color, and certainly light and silky in body, with crisp acids. Shows enough complexity to serve with your finest entr\u00e9es.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a pleasant red wine from Piedmont in northern Italy made with Nebbiolo and Vespolina grapes for a clean delivery of berry, spice and cola aromas. The wine is tonic and fresh in the mouth with clean acidity and playful bite of exotic spice on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Hard to keep from falling in love with this wine. It's so luscious in bright, spicy wild cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors. With a satiny texture and brilliant acidity, it's stunningly drinkable now, but should hold and develop over the next six years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Massively rich and ripe with blackberry jam, chocolate, anise and spice flavors, this Zin doesn't leave much to the imagination. You can taste the California sunshine and heat in every potent sip. The alcohol is very high, yet the wine wears it well. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Cometa boasts a brilliant, saturated golden color and carries through with clean execution in terms of aromas and flavors. Notes of tropical fruit and ripe citrus come into sharp focus thanks to Fiano's natural minerality. In the mouth, it offers plenty of weight, but balances that with great length on the finish, hinting at anise, honey, limes and oranges.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"From down in Paso comes this soft, chocolaty Merlot. Acidity is deficient, but this kind of flavor goes a long way to saving the wine, which has the taste of perfectly ripe, crushed blackberries.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This tastes and feels a little gritty, with dry tannins. There's something old-fashioned about it, in an era of lush, sweet Cabernetss that appeal in their youth. A rich core of blackberry and black currant suggests that time in the cellar will be rewarded. Hold until 2017 or so.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Opens with a nice nose of roasted nuts, banana, caramel and a hint of smoke. The palate's pear, baked apple and apricot flavors wear interesting coconut accents, but all these are unfortunately overrun by a scotch notes peek out from behind an edgy acidity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A light style, but still stylish, with finesse and good structure. The pretty plum fruit is lightly dusted with cocoa, softening the tannins and adding spice to the finish. A gentle and beguiling wine, ready for near-term enjoyment.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity. Some pretty flavors here, with lots of spice and soft tannins. Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Light raspberry along with charred wood carries the modest nose. Additional raspberry flavors blend with sweeter strawberry tastes to create a mildly creamy, easygoing palate. Finishes fairly buttery, with toast and popcorn notes. An attempt at a major-league wine that is semi-successful.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"One of two Tempranillos from Fenestra (the other from Lodi), the Livermore Valley version is bright, tasting of cherry spice, with good acidity. Nearing the finish the taste turns to toasty dark molasses; a nice wine overall.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"There is a ros\u00e9 here struggling to get out. This wine has strawberry fruits combined with tannins in a way that does not work. Bordeaux Clairet lies between ros\u00e9 and red in color and in taste.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with soft and luscious fruit tones of cherry and blackberry jam. Leather and tobacco add a savory, masculine quality, and there's a tart red-fruit flavor that adds a touch of refreshing acidity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Tart acidity marks this dry wine, interfering with the palate pleasure and causing some imbalance. Otherwise, it shows a tension of cool-climate raspberry and cherry ripeness with a touch of wintergreen mint. Give it more richness, and it's a great wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This has bell pepper and red currant aromas along with obvious oak and vanilla sensations, all of which carry over to the palate alongside a forward espresso note. A bit shy on vibrancy, it's also tightly tannic and demonstrates the heat of the vintage.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A mix of fruit that survived the big freeze, from Dwelley, Morrison Lane and Minnick vineyards. It's tight, tart and tannic, and showing some pickle barrel notes from time in new American oak. Herbal and compact, this is a wine that should probably be given another year or so in the bottle to smooth itself out.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The appellation is near the western, cooler part of Paso Robles, and the wine's rich chocolate fudge and creamy cherry and cassis flavors have the requisite acidity and tannins needed to temper them. Almost sweet on the finish, the wine redeems itself with elegance. The high alcohol isn't really a problem, in terms of balance.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aged in large oak casks, this dark and thickly extracted Ripasso does a nice job of integrating mature black fruit aromas with spice and tobacco. The oak element is nicely tucked in the background and the wine shows bright fruit flavors in the mouth as well.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This is way too soft and unstructured, especially at this price. It's a sweet, syrupy wine, with blackberry jam and cocoa flavors, and it's also high in alcohol.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Oak dominates this wine, withstrong notes of buttered toast, vanilla and sweet char. There's nothing wrong with those pleasant aromas and flavors, but the underlying wine, with its cherry and currant fruit, is overpowered by the wood.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made from DuBrul Vineyard fruit, this has lush strawberry and raspberry flavors that dig deep into the core, supported by a base of minerality. The tightly-focused finish includes echoes of toasty barrel-derived flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A mellow, well-rounded Petite that could almost be mistaken for blueberry tea, so prominent are those two strains of flavor in this wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A very fruity, extracted Zin, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors that finish with a bite of acidity. Clean and easy to drink, it's a nice sipper with summer barbecue.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Woody, brambly notes lend an earthy complexity to fresh blackberry and cassis notes on this bright, brisk Merlot. A shower of cranberry acidity jolts the palate and cuts through the fine, but penetrating tannins that fringe the finish. An elegant, refreshing example of a cool-climate Merlot.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g\/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Firm, solid, chunky, a great success from a ch\u00e2teau that is currently in top form, even in more difficult years. The bright fruits charge through the tannins, giving some richness, balancing with the elegance and freshness of the year. Worth aging.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Bright and aggressive for Llopart, with lively orange and apricot aromas. Frothy to the point of being bubbly, with ripe, bouncy pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Stays racy and citrusy on the finish. All fruit; not complex.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"With just 2% Syrah, this is a Bordeaux-style blend, feauturing mostly Cabernet and Merlot. The rich entry features berry, chocolate and espresso, with a round midpalate and polished tannins. A hint of tar runs through the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Blue-flower and red-berry aromas lead the way along with a whiff of eucalyptus. The firm palate offers hints of star anise, espresso and a green note of powdered sage that back up unripe red cherry. It closes on a coffee note.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Layered botrytis that gives the wine both its richness and dense texture. It is sweet but with a dry core and crisp acidity, it will age well. It is going to be a beautiful wine, with tropical fruits, apricots and wonderful final acidity. Drink from 2025.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Peachy Canyon's least expensive wine is a soft, simple, and rather sweet with candied raspberry and cherry flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lush, thick and chewy, with rich purple and black fruits, pepper and a finish of vanilla cream. The tannins are substantial but not intrusive; they carry a sensation of rock and graphite. Flavors extend themselves gracefully; the ripe fruit remains front and center, but it finishes with plenty of nuanced rock and spice and hints of herb. An exceptional effort.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Perfumed fruits offer a ripe counterpoint to the solid tannins. Dark cherries, a touch of wood and layers of acidity come together well, leaving the chance to age further. Drink until 2020.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This needs air to show its best, because at first it's tight, mulchy and nutty. Early on, it feels clampy and scratchy, but it becomes better as it airs. The black fruit flavors are touched up by notes of oak, dried cheese and leather\u2014characteristics that extend onto the finish.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"A very nice buy at this price. Dry and jammy, the wine features ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, anise, cocoa and mint, with smoky, oaky notes and mouthwateringly crisp coastal acidity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Obviously not in the first flush of youth, this dry ros\u00e9 goes more for mature almond marzipan along with cranberry juice flavors to give some tightness to the texture. Definitely to be drunk now. Screwcap.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"The winery's most popular wine, Cali is 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot and 4% Sangiovese. Nice aromatics lead into a medium-bodied wine with bright spices, strawberry preserves, some sour plum, and defining acidity, with a lick of chocolate in the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This cheerful Rosso di Montalcino offers a distinctively oak-driven bouquet of smoke, spice and mesquite followed by a bright ensemble of berry fruit aromas. The wine is soft and slightly sweet on the finish with a burst of cherry and blueberry at the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Immediately appealing for its lush, direct flavors of blackberry pie filling, cherry jam, licorice and cedar flavors, with a vein of dried herbs. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Harmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Amazingly delicious and soft. Defines the modern Napa Cabernet style, with the tasteful elegance Hall wines are known for. With 20% Merlot, it displays dazzlingly rich flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red currants and mocha, with a savory note of bacon. Now\u20132013.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a simple, no-fuss Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting herbal component that recalls dried oregano or hay. There's peach and citrus fruit at the back that is carried forward by spicy effervescence. The mouthfeel is thin and tonic.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Dark, thick with tannins, a sturdy wine with plenty of fleshy blackberry and coffee flavors. Bone dry, and can probably age for a few years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Sourced from old-vine W\u00e4denswil clones, this effort carries the new Elkton AVA designation. Pretty raspberry and strawberry fruit is set in lightly toasty tannins. This is a lovely everyday Pinot Noir with some density.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Prieto Picudo is a variety unknown to most wine drinkers. And that's probably a good thing, because the grape yields acidic, tight, astringent wines like this. Yes, there's color and size here, but there's not much balance or charm.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Very ripe, almost raisiny, with a cooked fruit flavor, although the wine is fully dry. The tannins are on the harsh side, and the stewed character seems to accentuate the acidity. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Viognier (60%), Roussanne (25%) and Marsanne, this wine is moderately aromatic with notes of pear, melon, apricot and flowers. It's medium bodied with abundant stone fruit flavors, quite reserved considering the warmth of the vintage.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a fresh and bright ros\u00e9 from Central Italy with a delicate bouquet of wild flowers and forest berry. The wine is luminous, pristine and would pair with appetizers or light summer pasta or chicken curry salad. In the mouth, the wine tastes fresh, crisp and clean.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A bit tough and sharp, but not a bad Cabernet. It has deep flavors of blackberries, currants, cola, anise and cedar, and is bone dry. You can bet there's some declassified high-end wine in this blend.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Bright, brambly berry and forest floor notes open this bouquet of this 80-20 Nergroamaro and Malvasia Nera blend. Touches of cherry and sun-ripened prune also make an appearance, especially on the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Kind of overripe in raisins and prunes, which detracts for me, but it's dry, with a chocolate and cassis finish that flatters the palate. The tannins are soft and sweet.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Future vintages of this wine will bear the new Red Mountain appellation, for that is where Klipsun is located. Waterbrook does the grapes proud: This is a juicy, ripe white wine bursting with scents and flavors of fresh fruits, cut grass, light spice and even some toasted coconut in the extended finish. Best Buy.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Robust, full and nicely structured with good acidity and medium tannins, this red offers up loads of jammy raspberry and blueberry with accents of carnation and mocha. Pepper and spice appear on the mouth and follow through the long, evolving finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Gold in color, with a ton of oak. But you know what? It works. The resin and vanilla aromas over time become attractive, while the rich palate deals coconut, toffee and baked white fruits. Yes, it's a barrique bomber from a hot climate, but it's interesting and should go well with roast fowl or foie gras.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Vibrant and lively red fruit aromas blend with fragrant woody spice in the bouquet. The cherry and berry flavors transition to the palate, where somewhat gripping tannins coupled with notes of fudgy brownie and black pepper add depth to the finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A sweet style of sparkling wine, with brisk acidity framing orange, lime, vanilla and honey flavors. Nice with wedding cake, at a good price.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A terrific mouthfeel highlights this mix of berry and cherry fruits, toast and cinnamon. Tart and focused, it was aged in roughly half new French oak for the first 10 months, then transferred to neutral barrels for another five months. Fine-grained tannins give it an elegant finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Crisp, light and redolent of red apple and forest berry, this wine should pair with fried chicken or easy pasta dishes. There's a sharp bitter berry note on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This appellation, on the west side of Salinas Valley just below Santa Lucia Highlands, is great for whites. Reds fare less well, especially when the vines are overcropped, as they seem to have been with this thin, acidic Merlot. It shows candied flavors of cherries and mint.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Pretty good Cab for the price, a little soft, but ripe enough, with upfront blackberry and cherry flavors and that chocolate fudge note that marks so many modern Cabs. It's a pleasantly dry wine with some real complexity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The fruit comes from two great Yakima Valley vineyards, Boushey and Elerding, and although the alcohol pins the meter at 15.3% it holds together with pretty cherry fruit, plenty of acid and tannin to provide the backbone. 266 cases produced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The term Vintner's Select, which is unregulated, can be abused. Here it really means something, as this is the winery's top cuv\u00e9e\u2014an excellent effort that spent 18 months in oak. There's extra depth in the cherry and cassis fruit, packing a powerful, compact punch all the way through a long, polished finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Slightly gaseous on the nose and losing freshness with each passing day. Zingy acids are keeping it alive but the flavors are slipping toward cranberry and tomato. Not much else is left.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This has some real strength to the fruit, which shows depth, nerve and muscle. There's a nice high note suggesting citrus, even grapefruit; below that some racy berry fruit flavors; then comes the impact of tannin and espresso. It all adds up to some real excitement in the mouth. A powerful wine that zings the palate and leaves you wanting more.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Briny citrus, feline notes and pithy scents send this Merseguera-led blend toward a pulpy, citrusy palate. Grapefruit and pithy, lightly bitter flavors finish citric, with little change from the wine's primary flavors.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"A delicious Talley Rincon, showing the class of this vineyard. Maybe not the best vintage, lacking some elegance, but the wine is ultrarich and full-bodied, with massive raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink soon.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine features tempting clove, black cherry and pomegranate flavors. It has great balance, an easygoing texture and a clean, fruity finish. It's medium to full bodied, but the oaky flavors and tannins stay well within bounds.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Rich in cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors, this Rh\u00f4ne blend has sweet-and-sour berry-cherry flavors. It's rich in dry, furry tannins. Needs something big and meaty to soften it, like beef stew.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"In 2003 the vineyard was going through some changes, and the vintage, the shift in focus and the winemaker's predilection for early picking seemed to conspire to produce a rather thin, austere wine. It's locked up tight, a bit herbal and lean, not yet revealing itself even with aeration. It's one of those mystery wines that you keep coming back to, waiting for the light to blink on.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fragrant and ripe, this brightly colored cab franc mixes flavors of pomegranate, red currant, spicy cherry and red apple. Forward and nicely fruity, it leaves out the new oak and finishes clean and crisp.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Tons of flavor in this ripe, juicy wine, which comes from Napa, Monterey and Lodi, an interesting combination of cool and warm climates. Bursting with cherries, blackberries, red licorice, cola, cocoa, dates and vanilla spice, the wine also is balanced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Terre di Giumara is a line of value wines. This Nero d'Avola offers bright aromas of berry, cassis, fennel, moist earth and almond that recall the natural fragrances of Sicily. The wine is simple, fresh and clean on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"The great sweetness of this wine makes its success. It's just delicious, offering up a mouthful of chocolate-covered cherry candy flavors with the sharpness of cassis. Crisp acidity and fine, dusty tannins make it elegant.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a curious, soapy wine with considerable bitterness. There is a toasty edge that shows some bottle maturity, and contrasts with the tense, tight acidity.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Packaged in an unusual plastic-style recyclable bag, with a seal you have to figure out how to open, this is a fine Sauvignon Blanc. At the equivalent of 10 bucks for a regular bottle, it's dry, crisp and fruity, with lime and gooseberry flavors. Delivers lots of bang for the buck.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A second label for Velocity Cellars. A light wine, with modest characteristics.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A 50-50 blend of Inzolia and Viognier, this feels slender and tight on the palate, with a drying note of talcum powder behind the flavors of citrus, honeysuckle and stone fruit.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Here's a fresh and easy blend of Trebbiano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon (at an attractive low price) that offers clean, but not very intense, aromas of cut grass, field flowers and lemon. The wine renders a sweet, chewy sensation in the mouth with soft texture and a creamy finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Though varietally labeled, this intriguing white Rh\u00f4ne includes 12% each Marsanne and Grenache Blanc. Rich and satisfying, it brings the buttery density of a ripe Chardonnay, but mixes the fruits for more drama\u2014cantaloupe, apricot, banana, and a bit of papaya. A total yum-fest.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a delicate and feminine ros\u00e9 sparkler that opens with a beautifully pale pink color and subtle aromas of wild berry, tangerine skin, white almond and passion fruit. It shows elegance on the palate, with fine perlage and tangy crispness.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This is blended from two finished wines: a 2005 Counoise (64%) and a 2006 Viognier (36%). It's ripe and round and showing strawberry and peach flavors. The two grapes work together well, and create a seamless wine with plenty of fruit power.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A very perfumed ripe wine. The fruit flavors range from mango through peach to a taut citric finish. With just a hint of wood, this is a bright and fruity wine, delicious to drink now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Sharp and a bit green, this has peavine and citrus flavors, the citrus a mix of flesh, rind, and sour candy. It was fermented in 100% stainless.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Soft, ripe and decadent, this Pinot, from the Napa side of Carneros, brims with blackberry, cherry, cola, vanilla, licorice and cinnamon spice flavors. It's full-bodied, but has Pinot's elegant silkiness. At its best now and for a couple years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lots of delicious raspberry and cherry flavors in this spicy wine, but it's just too sweet. That's probably a combination of residual sugar and extraordinarily high alcohol of 16.5%, which makes it almost Port-like.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Cabernet Franc has been the signature wine for Barrister since the first release in 2001. Once again it comes out dark and smoky in the house style, but with more spine and muscle than the Barrister Merlot. It's fully ripe and not at all vegetal, though you will find that it has the characteristic Cab Franc streak of pepper and coffee behind ripe black cherry and cassis fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Wow\u2014delicious, the best yet. Lots of pineapple from the 75% Celilo fruit, very crisp and lightly butterscotchy. Big but not heavy, with alcohol in the mid-13% range. The wine fills in the midpalate nicely, weaving together rock, metal, butter and tropical fruit flavors in equal proportions. Good length also.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a nice Chardonnay to drink with shellfish, particularly grilled shrimp. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with rich pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, accented with sweet, toasty oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aurelio Settimo's lively Dolcetto offers a surprise twist in the form of black fruit, Indian spice and natural rubber. The overall effect is rich in cherry and sweet fruit and the wine tastes plush and creamy on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, with pretty, ripe berry and plum fruit flavors in abundance. The toasty frame, medium tannins and hints of dried leaf add to the overall composition of this nicely-balanced, limited-production wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit \u2013 almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Juicy and round, this opens with scents of honeysuckle, yellow stone fruit and a hint of aromatic herb. The full-bodied palate offers ripe white peach, pear and a hint of candied lemon drop while a mineral note backs up the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This, the second wine from Clos de la Mar\u00e9chale, is light, very fresh, dusty in texture, the tannins held in suspension, with red plum and cranberry flavors.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Pretty dark and full-bodied for a ros\u00e9, and too extracted and heavy in cherry-berry flavors to be considered elegant. It's almost a red wine you could drink at room temperature.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This tight, taut and crisp wine needs some time to bring out its true fruity character. Behind the texture, ripe green plums and fresh apples are cut with lime juice. The wine is still young and could benefit from a few more months. Drink from late 2015.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of brandied cherry, crushed violet black pepper and a whiff of exotic spice lead the way. The round palate doles out dried plum, raisin, nutmeg, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2016\u20132021.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This starts light, with wild berry and bramble flavors, but it's nicely balanced and persists across the palate with pleasant milk chocolate flavors. Well integrated with good acids, this 100% varietal Merlot is pleasurable and easy drinking.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Give this fresh young Pinot a year to mellow. Right now, it's jammy in raspberries and cherries, with a citric sharpness. Needs brief time to knit together and become seamless.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An exquisite wine that combines delicacy and harmony with enormously fruity-spicy flavors that fill the mouth. The aromas suggest candied ginger, tropical fruits, vanilla and wildflowers. The flavors are effusively fruity and on the dry side, with refreshingly crisp acidity. Try it with Asian-Pacific fusion foods.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Great price for this unoaked white wine. It's smooth and crisp in mouthwatering acidity, with ripe flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, minerals and vanilla that finish with a honeyed richness. Easy to find, with production of 21,696 cases.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A pure strawberry jam wine, its ripe fruit scintillating with freshness and acidity. The wine is also round, with tannins giving some weight. The aftertaste is deliciously fruity.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"La Giaretta is an up-and-coming winery in full evolution with a modern approach and excellent pricing. There are deep oak aromas here that thankfully do not overwhelm delicate notes of cherry cola, cough drop, Indian spice, herbal infusion and almond. This is a spice-driven wine with a velvety texture and lively fruit on the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points. The flavors are wrapped in soft, easy but complex tannins. Fully dry and nicely oaked, this wine is immediately enjoyable.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Impresses for the sheer volume of the fruit. Flamboyant tropical pineapple, mango, guava, lots of dusty spices, rich oak, but manages to hold onto balance, dryness and even a sense of finesse all the way through the long finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Sweet meets earthy, with aromas that recall grilled beets, cola and sassafras. The bottling comes from the father-son team of Tondr\u00e9 and Joe Alarid, who planted their vineyard in 1997 and combined have nearly a century's worth of farming experience in the Salinas Valley. Homemade cranberry sauce wins the palate, and the wine has more tannins than most Pinot Noirs of similar age. Enjoy now or cellar until 2016 for even more emerging flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The nose is volatile and pruney, the color dark, almost Port-like. The wine is very soft and flat. The fruit seems waxy and dead, lightly pruney but also a bit green; it tastes as though half the grapes were underripe and half were raisined.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"On the sharp and lean side, showing sour red cherry candy, wintergreen and green peppercorn flavors, fattened with sweet oak. Dry and elegant, but not very rich. Drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A massive wine that could only have been grown under the California sun. Shows enormously ripe flavors of red and black currants, cola, red plums and spices, enriched with significant oak. Not particularly nuanced or elegant now due to the obvious power. Could age out, but the future is uncertain.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine's fruit is sourced entirely from the Conner Lee Vineyard. The superjuicy black-cherry flavor is balanced by generous acidity. Vibrant and full, long and fresh, this could age gracefully for a decade or more.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Tastes sweet, with cherry and blackberry jelly flavors, but racy and clean in acidity, like a simple, by-the-glass wine at a fast food restaurant.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Rounded aromas of melon and salty peaches rise to the nose on this wine from the Monterey County appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate is driven by citrus, grass and a rather extreme sense of sea salt, enhanced with mouth-watering acidity and a nectarine flesh finish. It's tasty though varietally uncommon.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A pear, apple-orange and earth bouquet sets the stage for a palate chockful of pineapple, pear and lemon flavor. Toast notes offset and vibrant acidity uplifts the fruit nicely. The finish is long and tart-sweet with complex leesy, earthy notes. Medium-bodied and restrained, this complex wine shows depth. Give it six months to a year to unfold.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A soft, medicinal and uninteresting wine, marked by harshness and green flavors that barely suggest cherries.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is sort of a second wine from Reverie. It's rustic and sharp, with tart, jellied blackberry and cherry flavors. Not going anywhere.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A nice, slightly sweet white wine, with tropical fruit, buttered toast, white flower and vanilla flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail sipper.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Soft and semisweet, with the honeyed, lemon-and-lime Gatorade taste, this everyday white is simple and clean.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A sophisticated blend of Merlot, Cabernet and Sangioveto from the newly inaugurated Frassinello winery designed by architect Renzo Piano. It has deeply etched oak tones over blueberry and forest berry. The close is fresh and crisp with very good length.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Ripe fruit notes of black cherry and raspberry are followed by chocolate and delicate spice. This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot from Maremma, Tuscany is sharp and well-focused in the mouth with lingering tones of ripe fruit and a crisp berry finale.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"With each bump up in price, the winemaker ups the percentage of new oak; here it's 25%. Half the fruit is estate grown, and this light, clean, well-balanced wine drinks like a village Burgundy, with the right hint of herb around the tart red fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ripass\u00e1 is a wine that has been refermented on the skins to produce extra richness and intensity of aromas. This distinctive wine offers tones of blackberry jam, currant, clove and curry powder. It's a luscious and slightly sweet tasting wine with chewy tannins.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Very ripe and aromatic, throwing out cascades of inviting scents. New toasty oak dominates, with undercurrents of blackberry jam, blueberry, mocha and anise. In the mouth, huge, lush, powerful, an explosively fruity young wine, yet maintains balance and elegance. Really good. Best now\u20132015.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Rich and toasty, this has aromas barrel-dominated aromas and flavors of vanilla and sweet, buttery oak. The underlying wine is strong in cherry and balsam flavors, which are girded by considerable tannins. Pair this with game meats, stews or barbecue to wrestle the structural elements into submission.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A feminine wine, soft, gentle and delicious in flavor. Feels light and silky in the mouth, with rich notes of cherries, raspberries, cotton candy, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood. Almost sweet, but it finishes nice and dry. Drink now\u20132013.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The Cabernet Sauvignon is from vines planted in 1972\u2014fruit that once went into Leonetti Cab. The other half is evenly split between Merlot and Cab Franc, crafting a flavor mix of herb and earth, with moderate density. It's nicely spiced, with brambly red fruits, and some butterscotch coming into the finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Some Cabs go into a dip at the age of five, and this may be one of them. It's a little awkward in structure, with a sharpness of feeling, and the oak isn't integrated with the ripe blackberry fruit. Could emerge and be fine in a couple more years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Showing the rich, exotic side of Viognier, this has ripe, flamboyant flavors of tropical fruit, white flower and spice. It has a controlled dryness and citrusy acidity; this is a lovely, versatile white.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A meaty Shiraz that pulls no punches, proudly displaying its black raspberry and earthy, salumi-infused flavors around a rich, dense texture full of leather and a touch of smoke. The Temecula Valley is continuing to make strides and this is a jumbo-jet-sized example that finishes a teensy bit sweet. The Shiraz is blended with 11% Cinsault.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Good color, but the very light cranberry fruit flavors have a strong mint streak running down the core of this wine. It's hard to find varietal character here; it's thin, herbal and a bit hard-edged.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Truckloads of fresh banana emerge from the nose, and are backed by vanilla bean, chalky minerality and some vitamin-like aromas. Somewhat dilute on the palate, but those banana notes put in another strong appearance. Imported by Vias Imports.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"The sulfur in my bottle was slow to blow off, and when it did, it revealed a toughly tannic, herbal wine. The tastes range from sage and tobacco to candied Life Saver blackberry and cherry to shriveled currants. Those pesky tannins turn up when you swallow, leaving behind a hard astringency.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Enticing spicy, toasty aromas and robust, dry fruit flavors are matched by very firm, fine-grained tannins in this full-bodied wine. Based on 65% Zinfandel, it has lots to offer, but at this stage an oaky sensation and the astringent mouthfeel indicate that it needs to mellow. Best to drink after 2018.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Broad across the palate, this brings flavors of orange soda and orange candy, with a grainy impression. It's fruit forward, with a quick fade.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This attractively priced wine has nice acidity and subtle flavors of pear and lemon. A pronounced swaddling in oak reveals itself on the nose and mid-palate. Enjoy it with food on the richer side.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Young and appealing now for its vibrant, upfront cherry and oak flavors, this supple Cab has a lush, fine array of dusty tannins, as well as fine acidity. It's beautifully balanced, a tremendously fruity wine that's has a classic structure and elegance.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ripe in blackberry, cherry and coffee flavors, with a sharp, angular mouthfeel due to acids and green tannins, this is a wine you might call rustic.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a bright-fruited wine with lively acidity and apple flavors. It has a creamy texture, a touch of spice and a lemon zest aftertaste. Drink now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Here you have more of the stiffer qualities of herb, leaf, earth and stem. Good concentration and length, with a full midpalate. The blend includes 8% Cabernet Franc.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This creamy Tuscan Chardonnay shares many characteristics with its distant cousin in California. It shows a decidedly New World style, with aromas of vanilla cream, dried apricot, honey, peach cobbler and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The finish is marked with a spicy toasted-oak intensity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A rich, ripe and complex Cabernet, with classic Napa tannic structure. Not quite up there with the winery's higher-priced Dollarhide or Elu bottlings, but showing similar elegance and taste. Brims with blueberry, mocha and cedar flavors that should develop over the next four years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lead pencil and hints of gravel come from Red Mountain fruit, with some of the welcome funk and grit in place from the Boushey Vineyard. Lovely aromas suggest violets and white pepper and hints of smoky chocolate. Smooth, tart, tasting of cherry and berry.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew. Big and a bit clumsy in the mouth, more vibrancy and freshness is needed to keep things in better balance. However, if you like 'em sweeter, this one's for you.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Basic Chard, if thin, with just enough peaches and cream, vanilla and toast flavors to satisfy.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This bright Sauvignon offers an aromatic medley of stone fruit, papaya, dried hay and fragrant yellow rose. The wine has good structure and a polished, clean finish that would work with fried finger foods or mozzarella bites.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Musella is a producer of very good reputation in the non-Classico zone, with some of Valpolicella's most beautiful vineyards. This plump ripasso offers density, with loads of sweet berry flavors to boot. Pair it with polenta and gorgonzola cheese. Imported by Vintners Estate Direct Importing.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine gives a clear, clean shot of pure raspberry fruit, lightly dusted with coffee and cocoa. A whiff of smoke drifts across the finish as the wine quickly thins out.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Though labeled Cabernet, it's a full-on, four-grape Bordeaux-style blend. It sports a classic Cabernet nose, dusty, smoky, with cherry tobacco, forest floor and a whiff of barnyard. The fruit remains tart and showing a fair amount of acidity; the tannins stiff and the mouthfeel tight but sensual. Give this one until 2017 to pull itself together.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Dark berry, tilled earth and gamey aromas lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers black cherry, chocolate, peppermint and oak alongside tightly packed tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2018.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A bit earthy and dry, with rich blackberry, tobacco and cedar flavors and a cherry-chocolate edge. Nice, firm tannins round out the finish. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very lush and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cassis flavors, with an oaky overlay, and there's a minerality toward the end that smacks of the soil. With an acidic jamminess and fierce tannins, the wine feels austere and remote. Give it 6 or 7 years in the cellar to come around.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Sengia Rossa is a blend of Corvina, Rondinella, Merlot and other varieties that shows plush, rich concentration and a soft, velvety feel. Aromas here include black cherry, cassis, leather, tobacco and a touch of licorice.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"It's easy to like this soft, smooth wine, with its cherry jam, blackberry liqueur, milk chocolate, sweet licorice, pepper and sandalwood flavors. It feels extravagant and seductive in the mouth, making you want another sip. The blend is Grenache, Syrah and Mourv\u00e8dre.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Estimating the ageability of a Pinot Noir can be tricky. This one, with hefty tannins, brisk acidity and loads of fresh primary fruit, seems to be ageworthy. Give it 5-6 years to let the structural elements begin to resolve and for the flavors of blackberry jam, Chinese tea, mushroom and spice to develop secondary characteristics.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"So good, it makes you want to shout. Possesses the beautifully ripe flavors that are expected of a great vintage, such as blackcurrant, cherry, white chocolate and cassis, with extra edges of smoky caramel and vanilla. The tannins are perfect, soft and easy, but as rich and complex as a Renoir. Differentiates itself from Napa with its softness and accessibility, but as great as anything from across the Mayacamas.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Young, tart and compact, this is still in the primary fruit phase of its development. Clean, impactful and nicely structured, its flavors run from cranberry to raspberry to light cherry, all running deep enough to suggest tucking it away in the cellar for a few more years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A slightly copperish hue suggests this wine has been made according to Pinot Grigio tradition (in which the wine sees longer contact with the skins). You'll get aromas of peach, nectarine, and honeysuckle followed by a crisp-clean mouthfeel.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"As rich as it is, this is a somewhat generic Cabernet. It's ripe and fruity and oaky, with appealing blackberry, currant and smoky wood flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. With a sweet finish, it's flashy, if not particularly complex or ageworthy.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A lovely, complex and flavorful Cab, but also tannic, giving it a lockdown feeling. There's a rich core of blackberries, black currants, spices and herbs, while new oak gives it a savory smokiness. Better after 2010, and should glide through 2014.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"I've found variability in Especial, despite its high price. It shows an artisinal, vintage-driven nature that can be beguiling or rough. The '04 is a bit of both. It's not a smooth, seductive Zin. The tannins are too feral. But it is interesting, with complex blackberry, blueberry, cherry and Asian spice flavors. Try aging, but not too long. You don't want to lose that fresh fruit.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The current downturn in demand for both grapes and expensive wines only helps A to Z; there is more good fruit to purchase, and plenty of demand at a $12 price point. This new Pinot Gris is fresh and racy, with a mineral-driven acidity underlying the clean fruit, tasting of pears and pear skin.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Huge, ripe flavors of blackberry and plum jam, mocha, black currants, anise and cedar mark this wine, grown in the rugged hills of southern Monterey County. It's quite tannic and dry, but doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Riper than you usually get from this Salinas Valley appellation, and more pleasing. It's rich in blackberries, cherries, plums and herbs, with a dry, spicy finish and firm tannins. Good value.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Barriano is a rosemary green and slightly vegetal blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that is balanced out by a good dose of plump red cherry in the mouth.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Jammy and fresh, with ripe, rich fruit. Apricot, Fig Newton, peach cobbler, cr\u00e8me caramel, honey, vanilla and toast flavors all mingle into a complex, spicy finish. The price of dryness is high alcohol, but the wine never tastes hot.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This luminous white wine benefits from added aromatic intensity in the form of creamy lemon zest, almond blossom and stone fruit. There's good density and richness here and the wine ends with generous fresh fruit flavors.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Heavy and dark in color, this is stalky on the nose, with a compost component that doesn't scream \u201cfresh and ready.\u201d It feels fairly snappy, but it tastes tart and slightly vegetal before finishing with rhubarb flavors.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Helped by extra bottle age, this Syrah is the best of the latest releases from Cliff Creek. Balanced and varietal, its spicy berry fruit is highlighted with grapefruity phenolics. Flavors penetrate and stand up well into a medium-long, balanced finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ripe but minerally, all flint and crisp fruit along with the richness from the structure and green plum and wood flavors. This blending of fruit from a number of Chablis Premier Cru vineyards shows the rich, ageworthy nature of 2005.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is what might be called old-style Washington Cabernet. The fruit is mixed liberally with bell pepper and dill; there is plenty of tannin and a distinctly earthy aroma of the barnyard that carries well into the finish. For some, it will be pleasantly reminiscent of cru Bourgeois Bordeaux.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Ribolla Gialla is a naturally creamy, soft variety, but this expression favors tonic soda aromas and tart lemon candy that help shape a racy and zesty impression overall.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Just touching maturity, this is a wonderful wine. With intense acidity, yeast, minerality and a beautiful final citrus texture, this is ready to drink but will age for many years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"An interesting wine you can call intellectual. Its appeal is as much conceptual as hedonistic. It's the opposite of today's soft, sweet fruit bombs, being bone dry and somewhat austere, showing a tightly knit tannic structure. With an explosive, but controlled, central core of blackberries, it's a cellar candidate. It will be fascinating to try this wine after 2014.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From the winery formerly known as Napa Ridge comes this modestly priced Cab. It's nicely ripe in all kinds of luscious blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, and although it's from the hot region of Lodi, somehow it manages to have crisp acidity.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"There's something old-fashioned about this wine, in its strong, edgy tannins and rustic mouthfeel. Yet it's high and hot in alcohol, with extracted, jammy cherry and raisin flavors. Doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An absolute gem from respected Languedoc produer G\u00e9rard Bertrand. The aromas draw you in immediately with intense, brooding notes of coffee, black fruit preserves, cocoa and tea leaves. The mouth, like crushed velvet, offers more black plum and blueberry preserve notes while dusty tannins dance in your mouth. Garrigue spice lingers in the finish. Hold until 2010\u20132013.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"An unusually deep color and black-cherry flavors help make this wine concentrated and full bodied. A thick layer of tannins puckers the mouth, but will help the wine pair with a roast or rich risotto. It's made from 76% Grenache and 24% Syrah.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Shows good Syrah character, a rich, spicy, full-bodied wine with luscious flavors of blackberries, black cherries, figs and tangerine zest. There's also a tangy minerality that gives the wine backbone and verve. Shows the promise of this mountainous Lake County appellation.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very floral and delicate, this is a wonderful Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting blend of floral and fruit aromas that come together in a generous, harmonious whole. It's easy and approachable and would pair well with lightly grilled sea bass or fresh water fish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Terre di Sofia is an oak-aged Chardonnay, with lemon zest, vanilla, exotic fruit, pineapple and light shadings of exotic spice. It's smooth and supple in the mouth.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Smoky and meaty smelling to begin with, like a mix of barbecued spare ribs and roasted berries. The palate is full, tannic and drying, with bacon, hickory and baked blackberry flavors mixed with herbs. Hard and clacky on the finish, but flavorful and solid throughout.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Jammy berry aromas are fiery and aggressive. In the mouth, this is sticky in feel, with huge, grabbing tannins and blocky ripeness. Chocolate and vanilla drape overripe black-fruit flavors, while the finish is heavy, chewy and tastes like fudge. Drink this forceful, oaky RDD now through 2020.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Here's a floral and delicate Cartizze with musky notes and a pretty embroidery of fruit salad. There are delicate mineral nuances that give it linearity and the pulpy fruit gives it texture and persistence.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo is enhanced with a small percentage of Merlot. That addition heightens the wine's softness and renders a richer mouthfeel.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Honey, peach, citrus and dried herbs comprise the nose of this simple Pinot Grigio. In appearance, the wine is almost transparent with a touch of gold and the mouthfeel is equally light and easy. The screwcap bottle has a cute picture of a green Vespa on the label to reinforce its all-Italy, Dolce Vita appeal.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Undoubtedly one of the two star properties in Moulis. Its quality is impeccable: a Cabernet-dominated wine, with superrich black currant flavors that retain great structure and aging ability. Enjoy this wine in 5\u201310 years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Soft and jammy, with raspberry and red licorice flavors and a streak of brambles, nettles and peppery spices. It's a good, dry wine, but would benefit from greater structure. A Syrah-based Rh\u00f4ne-style blend.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is made from fruit that's sourced mostly from Mercer's Spice Cabinet Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, with some Tablas clone Syrah from the Rattlesnake Hills. It's a tasty wine but it seems incomplete. It has a ripe purple-fruit flavor, and it comes with plenty of power, but there's a hole in the middle. The finish kicks in with a splash of molasses.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a very informal and easygoing red table wine that would taste great with pizza. It opens with a bright ruby color and shows aromas of cherry, raspberry and toasted almond.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Robust and full-bodied, with jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants, liberally sprinkled with crushed black pepper and cocoa. Dry and tannic, it's a Bordeaux blend, with Sangiovese and Syrah.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this is a rich, softly tannic and delicious wine. It brims with jammy blackberry, dark chocolate and sweet cedar flavors, in a sweetly chewy texture that hints at further ageability. Drink now\u20132015.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A soft wine that has easy but attractively ripe fruit. This is not a wine for aging, but in 2003, the estate has made a very drinkable wine. Patache stands for an ancient coaching inn, recollected on the wine's label by a coach and horses. Imported by Grands Chais de France.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"An upscale white wine made in the white Bordeaux style. It was partially aged in oak, on the lees, bringing a creamy, yeasty freshness to the citrus, tropical fruit and green grass flavors that are totally dry. Brisk acidity makes for a clean scour. A brilliant wine to drink with everything from goat cheese appetizers through firm fleshed fish like halibut to roast chicken.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"One thing you can depend on concerning Clos du Val's Cabernets is that they're elegant. The winery resolutely refuses to kowtow to the modern style of ultraripe, extracted fruit, high alcohol and massive oak. This lovely Cab, which contains a drop of Merlot, defines their style, and is a joy to drink. It has rich, complex cherry and blackberry flavors, flecked with earth and herbs, and is just beginning a long journey. Now\u20132021, at least.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"DDO's Chardonnay comes as close to white Burgundy as you will find in Oregon. Amazing finesse, with crisp, detailed aromas mixing flowers, peaches, melon and almonds. Impressive texture and a long, elegant and precisely-detailed path across the palate.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Roasted plum and raspberry aromas offer accents of vanilla, dill and dry wood. The palate is big, a little soft and chubby in the middle, with savory, herbal black fruit flavors that are meaty and deep. Finishes earthy, herbal and with integrity. This is Monastrell that's ready to go.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Very compact and clean in its aromatic delivery with banana, Golden Delicious apple and attractive hints of toasted almond in the background. Creamy, smooth and supple in the mouth with a touch of zesty spice on the finish. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Tarry, stalky aromas fail to make much of a statement. This is high in acid and rugged in the mouth, with a mixture of herbal red-fruit flavors and distinct stalkiness. A grating finish is racy and hot.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Polished and creamy, this is made to appeal to the popular style. It's rich and ripe in tangerine, apricot and lime fruit, with toasty, vanilla overtones. Brightened by crisp acidity, it's a lovely wine to drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made in the rich, ripe, over-the-top style that winemaker Mark McNeilly uses for his own Mark Ryan Viogniers, this is a superconcentrated wine with more than a passing resemblance to limoncello. Along with that comes notes of Key lime, candied pineapple and a bit of alcoholic heat. Some will find it excellent, others a little too extravagant.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Rustic and thin-flavored, with odd citrus and medicinal flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The winery's selection of its best barrels makes a fascinating wine, showing mixed Asian spices, supple fruit and beautiful fine-grained tannins. Muscular and detailed, it has a bit of an alcoholic kick to the finish. Powerful and very well-crafted.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made from estate-vineyard fruit, this Merlot is medium bodied, and it has a mix of red fruit flavors, plus grace notes of leaf and mushroom. The finish leaves an impression of dried toast.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine shows the potential and power of Valdeorras Godello, but at a fair price. It has a lot of minerality and acidity, but also a boatload of kiwi, green apple, papaya and white pepper. Unconventional for Spanish white wines and very much worth a look.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Fresh strawberry aromas set the scene for a bright, red berry flavored wine. It has vibrant, vivid acidity and exotic perfumes. The tannins, however, do suggest that this is a bigger, tougher wine than the fruit offers. Over the next few months, it is likely to fill out and become more dense.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Spicy and exuberant, if not particularly subtle, a big, juicy wine to drink with steaks and roasts. Bone dry, and pretty tough in tannins, it has flavors of blackberries, leather, cola, coffee and pepper. Ready now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This is a generic red wine. It's soft, with berry and coffee flavors and a scour of tannins on the finish, and dryish overall. Versatile with a wide range of things.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"While the surface of the wine is firmly tannic, the fruit brings in the richness and opulence underneath. The combination equals a ripe, wood-aged wine, with dry tannins that are beginning to integrate into the fruit.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Branded Bordeaux has a deservedly spotty reputation, but this year's Mouton Cadet aims to start turning that around. Cherries and chocolate on the nose, followed by smoky, earthy tobacco and black-cherry flavors. A silky texture makes it ready to drink now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A dense wine, tannic and firmly structured. It's one of those wines that are not for the faint-hearted with its power, concentration and medicinal character. Age for several years.","completion":"France"}

{"prompt":"Benito Ferrara delivers a very nice Fiano di Avellino that lives up to the excellent reputation of the wine thanks to its precise mineral tones and background notes of stone fruit and honeysuckle. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Very soft and direct, this Syrah offers lush flavors of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate, smoky oak and pepper. It seems at its best now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This vineyard designate from Yountville is packed with compact tannin and rich oak yet nicely balanced by crisp ranberry, cherry and clove flavors. Light black-pepper notes add seasoning.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Super dusty, leathery and big shouldered, this is also quite bright and drinkable. Made using grapes sourced from old vines planted within the Esola Vineyard.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Slightly fizzy at first, but honey and almond jump out from the start as the wine finishes light and dry.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Rounded and rich, this is an impressive wine. It has weight, with ripe yellow and white fruits to go with the intense acidity and citrus edge. The finish is crisp and taut. It's worth aging this wine for 2\u20133 years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Simple and harsh in texture, with wild berry, cola and pepper flavors wrapped into hard, green tannins that make the aftertaste bitter.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"If pink could have a taste, this is the wine. From hand-picked 100% Cabernet Franc, it is all about bright fruit and red berries. Soft with touches of caramel, it delivers good acidity at the end.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"There is definitely some good ripeness here but cherry and farmyard tones are hampered by a bit too much sulfur while the short finish shows some nice leather but also a funky undertone. Not the best of its class.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A fine Cava with easygoing white fruit aromas and a cushioned, full and round palate. Tastes rich and honeyed, with toasty, nutty, dry apple and pear flavors. Elegant and complex, with texture and style.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This is a lovely Morellino that delivers lively and easy aromas of cherry, blackberry and plum. As the wine is aged only in stainless steel to preserve its freshness, the integrity of the fruit is remarkable, and the mouthfeel is bright and focused.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"DDO's Chardonnay comes as close to white Burgundy as you will find in Oregon. Amazing finesse, with crisp, detailed aromas mixing flowers, peaches, melon and almonds. Impressive texture and a long, elegant and precisely-detailed path across the palate.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"For fans of semisweet bubbly in a bright salmon shade, this sparkler offers a confected nose reminiscent of watermelon Jolly Ranchers. Softly p\u00e9tillant with a heavy, syrupy texture, the palate is akin to liquid cotton candy.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is an attractively herbal rendering of C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages, offering hints of flowering thyme, sage and rosemary that are rounded out by flavors of just-ripe cherries. It's a medium-bodied wine, with a long on the finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is so delicious and classic, it's totally enjoyable now, but it has the structural balance to age for quite a while. It impresses for the complex blackberry, currant and cedar flavors and for the quality of the tannins, which are dramatically rich and ripe. Best now and for at least 10 years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a big, brawny, plush, \u201cinternational\u201d Amarone that sees 4 years of oak and delivers thick layers of espresso coffee, chocolate fudge, wood toast and honey nut. It has a chewy-viscous mouthfeel, rounded off by caressing spice flavors and very good length on the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Coming from a vineyard first planted by Mondavi in the late 1990s, this well-priced and widely available wine shows blackberry, violets, black pepper and just snapped dark chocolate on the nose. Fresh, lively black cherries and blueberries meld with fennel, tarragon and lots of herbal spice, all held together by smooth tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage. Blackberry and black cherry fruit, adorned with a sprinkling of Sumatra coffee beans, rocks on with polished tannins. The pleasing roasted character is just right to power it through a clean, sexy finish. Drink now and on through 2026.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This wine shows some stuffing, with black cherry\/black olive flavors and thick, rough tannins. Notes of moist earth, barnyard and alcohol burn through the finish. Though the label says 14% alcohol, itfeels higher.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"New, eco-friendly minimalist packaging and estate-grown fruit push this distinctive Walla Walla Valley Syrah to the front ranks. Juicy, sappy, tart and tangy boysenberry fruit flavors run through the bright midpalate. Tannins are soft and supple, with plenty of lemony acidity backing them up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Earthy aromas of brick dust blend with spiced cherry and tomato notes. A chewy, solid palate registers as correct, while this tastes of ripe, candied berry fruits and chocolate. A long, warm, slightly oaky finish sends this on its way.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"A good Zinfandel, dry and rich in the thick tannins you'd expect off Howell Mountain. The blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are liberally spiced with pepper. Loses a few points for a certain green herbaceousness.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a sweetly delicious young Pinot whose flavors are designed to please. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam, anise, cola, pepper and sandalwood notes, brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts\u2014the mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fragrant and spicy, this savory wine delivers aromas of ripe black cherry, blackberry and white pepper that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity while soft, polished tannins give a smooth, easy-drinking texture.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A subtle note of caramel adds richness to the baked apple aromas on the nose. On the palate, hints of chamomile tisane add to the baked apple flavors. The body is taut and linear. Rounded hints of baked apple persist even on the dry, clean and fresh finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A distinctive offering marked by a beautiful seamless quality, some exotic aromatic notes and a unique bottle design. Cedar, sandalwood and a sweet dustiness on the nose open to a cherry and toasty oak palate. Dry and even in the mouth. The finish has fine-grained tannins and a lovely back-end bouquet. Drink now through 2007.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Could almost be a Zinfandel, it's so jammy-fruity in raspberries, cherries, red currants and pepper, with firm tannins and a solid dose of acidity. It's also slightly sweet and one-dimensional.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A lovely Riesling made in the off-dry style of a fine German Kabinett. It's crisp and sleek in acidity, with a mineral undertow to the peach, pineapple, gardenia and petrol flavors. Very pretty and polished with pan-fried trout almondine.","completion":"US"}

{"prompt":"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot. Light cranberry and cherry fruit is set in a gently proportional bed of tart acid and pretty oak, 40% new.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This smells stalky and leafy, with a baked element. It shows tomato-driven acidity and red-leaning flavors of cranberry, tomato and raspberry that are touched up by notes of oak-based vanilla and dill. Tomato and tobacco flavors are key to the finish.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Clean and approachable, with lemon-lime aromas leading to an easy, mildly crisp palate with lemon, lime and honeydew flavors. Sweet in accordance with standard extra dry guidelines, and also good for ap\u00e9ritifs and sparkling cocktails.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"When first opened it is tight and herbal, with the scent of blood. But the subtle hints of rock and spice that underlie the pristine cranberry fruit need some years to unwrap themselves. This new 2006 Schindler comes out swinging, its wild berry fruit laced with earthy, barnyard funk. Tastes like an unbridled mix of fruit and soil, spice and barrel, that adds up to a vibrant, earthy, alive Pinot.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Belle Vall\u00e9e has made a nouveau-style Pinot Noir, very forward with light fruit flavors of strawberry candy.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The Lirano Soprano Barbera d'Alba is ripe with aromas of coffee and freshly ground espresso bean, followed by chocolate and a playful touch of white pepper. The fruit tones hold up nicely to round off the bouquet and the wine balances richness and freshness.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A pure, varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, from a mix of Walla Walla vineyards. With a great Cabernet vintage, a new consulting winemaker (Robert Smasne) and excellent fruit sources, Skylite Cellars hits a real high note here. Lush black cherry fruit is framed in ripe, chewy tannins; the wine is dense and textural, with hints of herb and alcohol at a moderate 13.5%.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A tightly structured wine marked by apple and peach flavors, but there's a young earthiness that keeps it from being a mere fruit-fest. Lush, creamy and complex, with real density and weight. Lots to like here.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Lemon and Anjou pear take the lead in this easy-drinking white, with secondary hints of faint toast and citrus rind adding depth and interest. It's balanced but there's a slight sharpness to the finish with a slightly pithy bitterness.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This is bone dry, with lots of zesty acidity and flavors of sour cherry candy, pomegranate and persimmon, with a mushroomy earthiness. It should change over the next four years, although not necessarily improving. Try pairing it with steak, lamb or a rich cut of ahi tuna.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A blend of equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is already a well-balanced, ready-to-drink wine. It has dusty tannins suspended easily in the black currant flavor, while the dry core brings weight. Drink now or age for two years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Marked by zingy acidity, this Malbec shows Cabernet-like black currant flavors and strong, rich tannins. Bone dry, it needs a good steak to punch through the astringency.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Entirely off the estate, this polished young Pinot offers a complex m\u00e9lange of flavors, in a balanced structure. The tastes of root beer, red currants, licorice, gingersnap cookie and sweet oak are frankly delicious. Fine now, and should peak by 2010, then hold for several more years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Dry and robust in tannins, this very fine Pinot Noir will benefit from some time in the cellar. With a silky texture, it shows tart coastal acidity framing flavors of sour red cherry candy, cinnamon, sandalwood and pepper. Best 2010\u20132012.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Notes of pink roses and wild flowers open the bouquet of this delicate selection. It offers cranberry and citrus flavors over an easy, fresh finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A good Cabernet for drinking now, with polished tannins and candied flavors of blackberry pie filling, sour black cherry Lifesavers and sweet, smoky sandalwood.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is a classic style of Cabernet that should improve with age. It smells like pencil shavings, tobacco and cedar, and tastes like dark chocolate and black cherry, while feeling very firm on the palate. It has fine-grained tannins, and a lingering dark chocolate and cherry finish. It will be best after 2018.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"May be getting old but still welcoming and mostly fresh. Citrus, melon and mango flavors are flush and clean, and the finish is racy and fluid. Normally Albari\u00f1o is a one-year wine, meaning you should drink it in the year immediately after harvest. Here's an '05 that's hanging in there and still showing kick. Drink now for best results.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This sparkling wine, a blend of 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, is dry, creamy and rich in flavors of citrus, yeast and vanilla. It feels refined and silky on the palate, with a honeyed finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Aalto is one of several smaller projects being led by former Vega Sicilia head winemaker Mariano Garc\u00eda, and we think this 2001 Pagos Seliccionados (PS) is his best effort to date. The wine is dark, with charcoal, lemon and pure black-fruit aromas. It features a brilliant luster and deep, rich, syrupy flavors of maple, boysenberry and black cherry. Shows a beautiful finish and amazing depth. Hold until 2006\u201307.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"With 6 Rh\u00f4ne varieties, including Viognier, this is a fresh, fruity wine meant to be consumed within the next five years. It's strong in cherry, blackberry and other berry flavors, with the smoky vanilla of oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This offers black currant flavors and firm, stalky tannins. It has acidity, a good juicy character and a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2015.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A distinctive Syrah that shows great concentration in the focused blackberry, sweet leather, dark chocolate, mineral and black pepper flavors. Beyond the power, the wine is bone dry, soft in acidity and quite tannic. The end result is impressive, and ready to drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Spicy, toasty wine, the fruit tropically rich. The texture is dense, the acidity important but not dominant. Delicious wine, now maturing well.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A five-grape Bordeaux blend, substantial and pretty. Sweet, slightly candied cherry and plum fruit opens the wine, which has some interesting layering, bringing in cassis, hints of herb and edgy tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This is a real New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and tart, with rich gooseberry, lime, green apple, Asian pear, vanilla and white pepper flavors. A touch of oak brings a pleasant, buttery toastiness. The grapes come from the cool Arroyo Seco AVA and the warm San Lucas AVA, a brilliant blending decision that makes this wine especially balanced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This tart and aromatic white blend could be labeled Chardonnay; less than a quarter is a mix of Riesling, Muscat, Gew\u00fcrztraminer and Pinot Gris. It's detailed and lively, with bright citrus, pineapple, pink grapefruit and sweet spice.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a luminous and bright Chardonnay with a well-balanced aromatic offering that spans from toasted nut to chalky mineral to exotic fruit. Overall, the wine tastes smooth and creamy, but there are a few sharp points of acidity that help move it along the palate. It's a sophisticated white wine in a very elegant bottle.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Dolcetto, Refosco and Nebbiolo, this red is a lusty, tannic, acidic, slightly sweet wine. Nothing fancy going on, but for sheer power, it impresses.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming. Interestingly, the wine is a bit more tart and refined on the palate, where zesty but full apple and pear flavors run the show. Not lean but definitely streamlined and acidic. More of a food wine than a stand-alone sipper.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"This is a small-production blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc made by a winemaker who knows a lot about Bordeaux blends, Genevieve Janssens, the longtime vintner at Robert Mondavi. It's ripe and pretty tannic, with cassis and smoky, 100% new oak flavors. An ambitious wine, it's quite good, and needs time in the cellar to soften and resolve. Best after 2008, at least.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Made from organically farmed grapes, this offers tropical and white stone fruit aromas. On the bright palate, a saline hint underscores yellow apple, Bartlett pear and citrus fruit. It finishes clean and crisp.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Acorn, which does such interesting things with Rh\u00f4ne varieties, shows it's no slouch with Bordeaux varieties, to judge from this fresh, succulent young red wine. It's medium-bodied and dry, with polished flavors of cherries, blueberries, leather and herbs and a long, spicy finish.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here's a wine that holds its own in a ranking of top Nebbiolos. There's depth and great promise of fruit here, which is wrapped within folds of vanilla, ginger, cinnamon and dusty mineral. The mouthfeel is plush and velvety and the wine ends with tart but succulent tannins. It will drink beautifully for five-plus years.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This makes you wonder why it took so long for California vintners to understand that Chard doesn't have to be drenched in oak to be succulent. The wine is crisp and dry in pineapple, pink grapefruit, green apple and cinnamon spice flavors. Great with shellfish and grilled chicken.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Quite a beautiful Cabernet, showing Oakville character of black currants and cedar and profoundly fine tannins, as well as a great depth of flavor and ageworthiness. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's lush and dramatic now, and should easily develop over the next 6\u201310 years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Here is a plush and elegant Barbera d'Alba with bright fruit tones followed by graphite, a dash of exotic spice and pretty earthy nuances. The wine is bright and fruity in the mouth with cherry and blackberry on the close.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Wild Horse captures the essence of Central Coast Pinot. The wine isn't especially complex or ageable, but defines the fruit and acid balance of the region. Cherries, black raspberries, root beer and spiced rum punch are the flavors, and the wine is silky and dry.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Unique and appealing, with scents of pear drop and roasted walnuts leading into a luxuriously textured palate. Caramel notes from toasty new oak vie with kiwi flavors in the mouth while the finish is long and dry. Drink now or age a few years for even more complexity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This opens has a bold appearance with dark extraction. The aromas that follow are reminiscent of ripe cherry, cinnamon spice, plum and pulpy black fruit. Round and soft, this closes with firm grittiness.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Already past its prime, this Garnacha-based rosado has sweet nectarine aromas along with a sugary, creamy palate. If it had more zest upon release, that's mostly gone at this stage. Wait for the 2006.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Very pure\u2014this has a straight line of acidity right to the wine's citrus- and pineapple-flavored heart. It is structured and taut, with its acidity dominant. It is concentrated and ready to age for 2\u20133 years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Aromas suggest apricot, lemon drop, exotic fruit and subtle oak. The forward palate delivers yellow peach, nectarine, green melon and lemon drop alongside a note of vanilla.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This is mucky and sweet. Its best foot is not put forward via the compost-like nose, and from then on there's little more than prune, leather and a sticky mouthfeel.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Cherry and vanilla are this ripasso's most prominent aromas but if you dig deep you will uncover Spanish cedar, blueberry tart, maple syrup and Indian spice. The wine has a bright personality and offers loads of ripe fruit in the mouth. Imported by Solstars Inc.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Intense aromas recall tropical fruit, crushed tomato vine and Granny Smith apples. The bright, juicy palate offers white peach, apricot, papaya, cantaloupe and almond, along with crisp acidity.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Full-bodied and dry. You can taste the Pinot Noir in the black and red cherry and red currant flavors. A bit rough in texture, but pretty good for the price. Will pair well with roast salmon or even a lamb chop.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The nose is heady and fragrant, edged with dried chamomile and hay flowers and subdued honey. Underneath that is a notion of sweet, luscious apricot compote. With time, there are the most subtle notes of enticing pine resin and fir honey\u2014lit and illuminated all the way by the purest and most concentrated of lemon acidity. A triumph of balance and richness.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Decent and crisp, with waterered-down citrus flavors. Finishes a little sweet.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The partner to Copains d'Abord, this wine sports a label of women having a good time at a party. The wine suits the image: fresh, fruity and juicy.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriyaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a great value.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fruity, crisp with red-currant and citrus flavors, this is a bright, vivacious wine. There is a tight mineral edge that contrasts with the fruitiness and turns this into a food friendly wine. Drink now.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A smooth wine, the tannins suspended within a velvet texture, resulting in an opulent, rich feel. This is very intense, with medicinal and dark plum skin flavors. Powerful, solid, for aging.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Showing lots more depth and focus than Husch's regular Pinot Noir, this wine comes from nearly 40-year-old grapes grown on the estate. It's charming, light and silky in the mouth, with brilliant acidity framing intense flavors of cherries and spices. Should age well for up to a decade.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"There's a tight, tannic coarseness to this Petite Sirah that makes it a little bitter and difficult. On the other hand, it's elegantly structured, with a rich core of blackberries. This suggests ageability, it could improve in the bottle.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Big, rich and fruity, with fantastically ripe cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors that are elevated by a note of sweet sandalwood, and brightened with crisp acidity. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the long, spicy finish. This is too young to drink now; it needs 5\u20136 years to mellow.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Heavy on the oak, with overpowering buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. Underneath all that are pineapple and peach flavors. The finish is sweet and heavy.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"You'll notice a unique and terroir-driven note of freshly milled white peppercorn that distinguishes this Amarone. In the background are generous tones of berry, black mineral and toasted almond. Pair this extraordinary wine with roasted meat or aged cheese.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A ripe and rich Barbera d'Asti Superiore with pleasantly inviting aromas of ripe blackberry, Maraschino cherry and exotic spice. All those aromatic layers are washed clean over the palate thanks to the wine's fresh acidity that kicks in on the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"This simple red is a great food wine, and it would pair with just about anything containing meat or cheese. It has heft and determination, with bright accents of cherry, red rose and dried apple.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"Pinots from this vineyard, which is between the Anderson and Alexander valleys, always seem earthy and tannic in youth, and so it is with this bottling. With oak-inspired cherry, cola, tobacco and spice flavors, it could develop bottle complexity in 4\u20136 years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"The problem with this wine is the wood. There is too much of it, and the toasting is too high, giving a burnt character to the wine. For a 2005, this should be better integrated, and is likely to just dry out.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"An oaky, hearty wine that in many ways wants to be Chardonnay. The nose exudes fresh-cut wood, while the flavor profile is all about buttered toast, apple and peach. Stylistically, it's California all the way, yet there's enough acid and natural flavor to help it from being too heavy.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Bright, round and delicious, this has exotic fruit, white flower and cantaloupe aromas that follow through to the lively palate, along with honeydew melon fruit. It has noteworthy freshness for the vintage.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"From a vineyard called Sweetwater, this Riesling itself is sweet in peach, pineapple and wildflower honey flavors. Brisk Monterey acidity balances, with a tart, prickly mouthfeel.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished SB benefits from crisp acidity provoked by its cool growing region. The flavors are of figs, citrus fruits and nectarines, but they could be a bit more focused.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Marion makes some of the best Amarone on sale today and this standout expression from the stellar 2004 vintage proves the point. The wine is thick, deliciously succulent and redolent of mature black fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and pipe tobacco.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"An unusual blend of 80% Clairette and 20% Bourboulenc, this medium-bodied wine is crisp and citrusy, marked by pineapple and hints of underripe peach and pear. It's light enough to be paired with more delicate seafood dishes over the summer months.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Thick, ripe, creamy and luscious, this 15.4% S\u00e9millon carries itself with grace and style. The dense fruit flavors mix peaches, apricots, pears and spicy apples; with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Though quite dry, it has so much fruit as to seem lightly sweet, and the high alcohol does not take away from the complexity. If it were not fermented dry, this would be a stunning late harvest dessert wine.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This vintage marks a big step forward for this Oregon Sauvignon Blanc. As fresh and racy as a bright young Quincy from the Loire, this sappy Sauvignon has the snap of natural acidity and a tongue-tingling mix of melon, lime and grapefruit on the palate. It's drinking beautifully right now while at its most fresh.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"So much fruit, so much acidity, such a nice PG. It's all about apples, peaches, limes and wildflowers, dry and delicious, and the most remarkable acidity for balance. This lusty wine is versatile with all sorts of different foods.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Another spectacular effort, though they've bumped up the price significantly. This is beautifully varietal, mixing floral, bath powder, apple and grapefruit components in both the nose and the mouth. There is an elegant intensity that powers the wine through an exceptionally long, brilliant finish; the residual sweetness keeps the alcohol down to 11.5% without making the wine either soft or sugary. 14,500 cases produced.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Fans of Petit Verdot, which has almost attained cult status in Washington, will not want to miss this spectacular effort. Bright, chewy and muscular though it is, the tannins have been polished perfectly, and set off with 40% new oak, adding dark, smoky chocolate and espresso flavors. The acidity keeps up, underscoring tart berry fruit with some sweet green-tomato highlights.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A curious wine. It's not tasting at all good now. So tannic, so new oaky, it feels clumsy and astringent and awkward in the mouth. Then you realize how rich the heart of fruit is, offering an enormous array of blackberries, blueberries and black currants. The grapes are from Rutherford. The gamble is if the fruit will outlast the tannins.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"An extraordinary wine, dry, crisp in acidity and wonderfully silky in the mouth. The flavors are deep and complex, changing with every second as the wine breathes. Raspberries, wild clove and cinnamon spices, cola, dried herbs, things that taste earthy and minerally and woodsy. Insanely complex and dynamic, this Pinot should age for up to eight years.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"From the C\u00f4te de Rouffach area, this is a wine that's eminently alive. Apricot, nectarine and mango comprise the all-fruit nose and palate. All in all, it's like a peachy parfait. If you dig deep you'll find some of those custard, stone and petrol nuances that give Alsace Rieslings their character.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A useful Zin, rich and sweet and savory. Blended for complexity with Syrah and Petite Sirah, it's satisfying in black cherry, red licorice and cola flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and baking spices. Easy to drink with barbecue, burgers and such.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"A ripe, soft, nut- and pear-flavored wine, with fresh acidity. It is smooth, velvet in texture, with some apple juice freshness on the finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"A rich, but mineral driven wine, with flavors of quince, citrus and green herbs. This is young but over 2\u20133 years it will develop into a richer, smoother wine.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"This low-production Chardonnay shows the oaky, ripe notes. It has strong, forward tropical fruit, peach, lemon and lime flavors, with lots of buttered toast and vanilla bean.A firm minerality adds complexity. Drink up.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"I drank this at the end of a long, hot summer day, which is when a cold, crisp white is at its best. What a delicious wine. Bold citrus and apricot flavors, acids so strong they almost fizz and a rich creaminess even though there's no oak.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Smells and tastes porty, but dry, with raisiny-chocolaty flavors of blackberries and currants. Drink now.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Young and fresh, it has excellent minerality. The fruit is light and lively, leaning toward grapefruit, green apple and a smidge of just-ripe melon. It's a lovely summer sipper, with a few good years of life ahead.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"With an off-putting orange color, this Rh\u00f4ne-style blend seems sweet, with orange, apricot and vanilla flavors.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Crisp strawberry, rose petal, peach flesh and a wet cement aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a winery just behind Cambria. The palate tingles with acidity, delivering ripe nectarine and plum flesh flavors, further enlivened by a touch of sea salt.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Dark fruits\u2014notably black cherries and figs\u2014come with a chocolaty edge. The citrusy acids keep the wine on point as it slowly fades.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"This is made using a selection of fruit that's sourced from both banks of the Serein River. It's a properly crisp Chardonnay, and it offers a white fruit flavor and a bright, lively finish.","completion":"France"}
{"prompt":"Quite green and also raisiny, which doesn't really compute seeing that one indicates underripeness and the other overripeness. But throw both together and you get a wine that's not all that pleasing and seems to be striving for equilibrium. Gummy, green and thick-tasting in the mouth. A hard wine to get excited about.","completion":"Spain"}
{"prompt":"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least.","completion":"US"}
{"prompt":"Hats off to the Zonin family for being among the first to offer a Viognier from southern Tuscany. This shows the thick viscosity that is characteristic of the variety, with floral notes of violets and lemon blossoms. There's a dusty touch of mineral or brimstone on the finish.","completion":"Italy"}
{"prompt":"A beautifully drinkable Merlot. It's softly tannic and quite dry, with a polish of smoky oak that frames deep, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and exotic spices. Very nice now and for the next 3\u20134 years.","completion":"US"}
