{"prompt":"Aged in American oak, with mostly similar vineyard sources. The American oak, with more spice to the fruit, and less smoothness overall than the C'est Belle Bottling. Cherry and berry flavors abound; it's sturdy, solid and well-made. Just 170 cases produced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ripe in blackberry, cherry and coffee flavors, with a sharp, angular mouthfeel due to acids and green tannins, this is a wine you might call rustic. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Raw and fresh, with jammy mulberry, blackberry and pepper flavors. A rustic wine for rustic food. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Cherry, citrus rind and oak make for a short, stout nose. It seems more precise on the palate, with pure cherry and coffee flavors poking through a veil of tight tannins. Gets even firmer on the finish, with a smack of raisin. A wine that requires airing; or more cellar time. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Cabernet Franc has been the signature wine for Barrister since the first release in 2001. Once again it comes out dark and smoky in the house style, but with more spine and muscle than the Barrister Merlot. It's fully ripe and not at all vegetal, though you will find that it has the characteristic Cab Franc streak of pepper and coffee behind ripe black cherry and cassis fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"For eight bucks you get a rich, creamy taste of pineapples, green apples and cinnamon spice. Not quite sweet, not quite dry, but balanced with crisp acidity. A bargain. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A soft wine that has easy but attractively ripe fruit. This is not a wine for aging, but in 2003, the estate has made a very drinkable wine. Patache stands for an ancient coaching inn, recollected on the wine's label by a coach and horses. Imported by Grands Chais de France. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"With aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This tasty, toasty red wine is all Sangiovese. The tangy red berry fruit flavors carry highlights of peppery herbs. With some air time the wine smoothes out and rolls into a creamy, mocha-infused finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Bright and aggressive for Llopart, with lively orange and apricot aromas. Frothy to the point of being bubbly, with ripe, bouncy pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Stays racy and citrusy on the finish. All fruit; not complex. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Acorn, which does such interesting things with Rhône varieties, shows it's no slouch with Bordeaux varieties, to judge from this fresh, succulent young red wine. It's medium-bodied and dry, with polished flavors of cherries, blueberries, leather and herbs and a long, spicy finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"For a Petit Chablis, this is serious and complex, with delicious ripe green and yellow fruits; there is a touch of caramel with toast just at the edge. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This contains a fairly high proportion (10–15%) of Viognier, but still seems more tightly packed than Faury's 100% Syrah Saint-Joseph. It's riper, with more cherry-berry fruit and less meatiness, but still has great floral aromas and hints of pepper on the finish. Drink now–2015. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This wine shows some stuffing, with black cherry\/black olive flavors and thick, rough tannins. Notes of moist earth, barnyard and alcohol burn through the finish. Though the label says 14% alcohol, itfeels higher. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This luminous white wine benefits from added aromatic intensity in the form of creamy lemon zest, almond blossom and stone fruit. There's good density and richness here and the wine ends with generous fresh fruit flavors. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Here's an oak-aged Chardonnay from northern Italy that offers the bright intensity of peach, melon and yellow flower backed by the elegance of toast and roasted nut. The wine is creamy and soft in the mouth with some bitter almond notes on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Heavy and dull in the mouth. They seemed to have picked the darkest, ripest, softest, plummiest lots, and then plastered the wine with oak. Not bad for a Grenache, but lacks the vibrancy and lift you want from Pinot Noir. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Not much going on in this watery wine. It tastes like alcohol with a few drops of grapefruit juice. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Texture is the name of the game here. We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made from vineyards throughout the village of Serralunga d'Alba, this straightforward wine is still closed. It reveals black cherry, espresso, prune and subtle oak alongside a note of tire rubber. It's still extremely young, with aggressive tannins that dry out the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a real New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and tart, with rich gooseberry, lime, green apple, Asian pear, vanilla and white pepper flavors. A touch of oak brings a pleasant, buttery toastiness. The grapes come from the cool Arroyo Seco AVA and the warm San Lucas AVA, a brilliant blending decision that makes this wine especially balanced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rounded and rich, this is an impressive wine. It has weight, with ripe yellow and white fruits to go with the intense acidity and citrus edge. The finish is crisp and taut. It's worth aging this wine for 2–3 years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Bubbly and bright, this is a luminous Prosecco Brut with pretty floral fragrances and clean mineral nuances. It has persistent bubbling and a compact texture that ends with zesty crispness and drying mineral tones. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1\/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"It's easy to like this soft, smooth wine, with its cherry jam, blackberry liqueur, milk chocolate, sweet licorice, pepper and sandalwood flavors. It feels extravagant and seductive in the mouth, making you want another sip. The blend is Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made in a directly appealing style, this Syrah is soft and slightly sweet. It offers flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and milk chocolate, with notes of anise and tangerine rind. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a well-structured juicy, fruity wine. Aromas of redcurrants, and flavors of fresh black fruits, are balanced by firm, dry tannins and some acidity. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Unbalanced, with lots of acidity, hard tannins and raisiny flavors alongside green ones. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The '05, as befits a cool vintage, is lean, with the alcohol showing through bare-bones citrus flavors. Even those who like their whites dry and flinty may find this Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier blend a little thin. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The aromas of lemon, soil and flowers are quite subdued. The flavors are restrained with impressive balance and the variety's often burly tannins well tamed. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a young, tight wine. It stuns with strong acidity and a bitter lime zest, almost gooseberry tartness. But it's nobly structured, and badly in need of a year or two in the cellar, or extended decanting. Oxygen and warming up bring out exciting notes of tropical fruits, buttercream and oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a simple, no-fuss Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting herbal component that recalls dried oregano or hay. There's peach and citrus fruit at the back that is carried forward by spicy effervescence. The mouthfeel is thin and tonic. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This red Passito dessert wine from Tuscany offers bittersweet aromas of wild cherry, raspberry, cassis and cola. It makes a simple but clean impression in the mouth and would pair with chocolate brownies or cherry pie. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Even though it is weighty, very full and dense, the wine has a fine balance, with acidity that cuts through the richness. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with soft and luscious fruit tones of cherry and blackberry jam. Leather and tobacco add a savory, masculine quality, and there's a tart red-fruit flavor that adds a touch of refreshing acidity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is quite flavorful, with apples, pears and peaches equally in the mix. The fruit is front and center, and the wine has unusual polish for its price. It keeps coming on through a surprisingly long finish, with nicely structured skin and rind flavors wrapping up the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The sulfur in my bottle was slow to blow off, and when it did, it revealed a toughly tannic, herbal wine. The tastes range from sage and tobacco to candied Life Saver blackberry and cherry to shriveled currants. Those pesky tannins turn up when you swallow, leaving behind a hard astringency. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Firehouse Red is Tamarack's bread-and-butter wine, and rightfully so. Though it's a mélange of Cabernet, Syrah, Merlot, Franc, Malbec and more, it pulls itself into focus with spicy, slightly high-toned fruit, bright and herbal. The mix of tart red fruit, nettles and wild herbs bring a lot of complexity to what is essentially a mutt wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This makes you wonder why it took so long for California vintners to understand that Chard doesn't have to be drenched in oak to be succulent. The wine is crisp and dry in pineapple, pink grapefruit, green apple and cinnamon spice flavors. Great with shellfish and grilled chicken. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ultraconcentrated and almost heavy on the nose, but not fully syrupy or leaden. Has a heavy disposition in the mouth, with brown sugar, caramel and other usual suspects making up the flavor profile. Creamy and chunky on the finish. Excellent dessert wine for the price. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Aged in new barriques, this opens with aromas of oak and oak-driven spices and a whiff of savory herbs. The palate is dominated by oak, vanilla and coffee that muffle the dried dark-cherry and mineral flavors. It has a linear quality but lacks fruit richness and is still in the vice-like grip of wood tannins. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Fattoria Scopone's 2004 Riserva opens with charred aromas of campfire, liquid smoke and barbecue sauce. The fresh fruit notes tend to be on the ripe side: think mature cherry and strawberry. In the mouth, however, this well-crafted wine is smooth, silky and long lasting. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This gets an extra year in barrel and bottle prior to release. It's two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Syrah and 5% Petit Verdot. Still tart and tannic, the wine carries a full load of herb and earth characteristics, with less impact from the fruit than the high alcohol would suggest. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Sharp and a bit green, this has peavine and citrus flavors, the citrus a mix of flesh, rind, and sour candy. It was fermented in 100% stainless. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With its rounded texture and smooth wood and yellow fruits, this is a generous wine. It has weight and some richness tempered with acidity and a prominent apple skin character. In another few months, the wine's richness will show better. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A dense wine, tannic and firmly structured. It's one of those wines that are not for the faint-hearted with its power, concentration and medicinal character. Age for several years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This offers appealing notes of cranberry, cherry and orange peel along with a kiss of vanilla. It's tart and fresh in style with puckering fruit flavors—perfect for the dinner table. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Nice aromas of pie crust, red fruit and some barnyard lead to a tart, simple wine with watered-down flavors of red berry. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Some Cabs go into a dip at the age of five, and this may be one of them. It's a little awkward in structure, with a sharpness of feeling, and the oak isn't integrated with the ripe blackberry fruit. Could emerge and be fine in a couple more years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4–6 years and see where it goes. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This opens with a pretty floral fragrance of acacia, Spanish broom and chamomile. The palate doles out white peach and tangerine zest alongside fresh acidity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Although this is Ste. Michelle's widely available Merlot offering, it breaks the mold by being held back a considerable time prior to release. It's an unusual wine, with scents of overripe, raisined fruit, a streak of tobacco and black licorice, a soft midpalate, and some bitterness in the finishing tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This proprietary bottling from Shafer is always a huge wine. The 2010, which contains a splash of Petite Verdot, is gigantically packed with blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak, courtesy of 20 months in 100% new French oak barrels. The wine is a bit of a bully now, but it has the balance to age. Give it until 2018. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a simple and fruity Nero d'Avola that offers fleeting blackberry and tart red-cherry flavors alongside fresh acidity. Pair this with pizza or with other everyday, informal meals. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"When this bottling is from a ripe vintage, it can be quite good. But the cool 2007 harvest has yielded a somewhat green wine. It has grapefruit and gooseberry flavors that veer into feline territory. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Wow—delicious, the best yet. Lots of pineapple from the 75% Celilo fruit, very crisp and lightly butterscotchy. Big but not heavy, with alcohol in the mid-13% range. The wine fills in the midpalate nicely, weaving together rock, metal, butter and tropical fruit flavors in equal proportions. Good length also. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Stiff and tart, this young wine needs a few more years of cellaring to fill itself out. The balance is right, and the vineyard's full-bodied tannins are there in abundance. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"So much fruit, so much acidity, such a nice PG. It's all about apples, peaches, limes and wildflowers, dry and delicious, and the most remarkable acidity for balance. This lusty wine is versatile with all sorts of different foods. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dry and robust in tannins, this very fine Pinot Noir will benefit from some time in the cellar. With a silky texture, it shows tart coastal acidity framing flavors of sour red cherry candy, cinnamon, sandalwood and pepper. Best 2010–2012. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Will appeal broadly to many Pinot lovers for its soft, lush array of flavor. Raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice and bacon all lead to a long, spicy finish. Trades complexity for immediate appeal, so drink up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Robust, full and nicely structured with good acidity and medium tannins, this red offers up loads of jammy raspberry and blueberry with accents of carnation and mocha. Pepper and spice appear on the mouth and follow through the long, evolving finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is a nice wine for drinking now. It's very forward in blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, and finishes a little sweet. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A 50-50 blend of Inzolia and Viognier, this feels slender and tight on the palate, with a drying note of talcum powder behind the flavors of citrus, honeysuckle and stone fruit. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Somebody was carried away with wood here. The wine is totally dominated by flavors of burnt wood— even the 50% new wood was too much in 2007. That said, the fruit could increase in weight and black berry flavors. But not just yet—in another three to four years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A fine Cava with easygoing white fruit aromas and a cushioned, full and round palate. Tastes rich and honeyed, with toasty, nutty, dry apple and pear flavors. Elegant and complex, with texture and style. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Big, bold and concentrated, this full-bodied wine was given the complete new-barrel, lees-stirring treatment. It has a deep gold color, with ripe pear and buttered toast aromas that transition to waves of pear and apple on the palate and lingering finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of black cherry, licorice, leather, violet and a whiff of tobacco open this wine. The palate is still a bit closed but delivers black raspberry, wild cherry, anisette and a note of black pepper alongside big, brooding tannins that need time to come around. Drink 2017–2024. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a pleasant red wine from Piedmont in northern Italy made with Nebbiolo and Vespolina grapes for a clean delivery of berry, spice and cola aromas. The wine is tonic and fresh in the mouth with clean acidity and playful bite of exotic spice on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A gorgeously salmon-colored rosé made predominantly from Grenache (62%) co-fermented dry with Viognier (58%) out of Yolo County. The wine has a delicately pretty nose of peach and a light-medium body despite its 14.8% alcohol, though the finish falls off fast. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Moody, complex and brooding, this is a superb wine and an exceptional value. Purple violets, black forest cake, cocoa nibs and espresso granules all abound on the nose, backed by dark juicy black raspberries. Full and firmly structured in the mouth with notes of pepper, tea, smoked meat and black fruit on the palate. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A blend of equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is already a well-balanced, ready-to-drink wine. It has dusty tannins suspended easily in the black currant flavor, while the dry core brings weight. Drink now or age for two years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Viognier does well in warm climates and this Sicilian expression of the French grape shows pretty floral nuances backed by white almond and orange blossom. Pair this wine with sea bass grilled in lemon leaves or fried squid. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The fruit comes from two great Yakima Valley vineyards, Boushey and Elerding, and although the alcohol pins the meter at 15.3% it holds together with pretty cherry fruit, plenty of acid and tannin to provide the backbone. 266 cases produced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Penedès? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it. The nose is meaty, ripe and round, while the palate features pure core fruit backed by chocolaty warmth. With kick as well as subtlety, this is a bargain hunter's dream. Imported by Grapes of Spain. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Thick, ripe, creamy and luscious, this 15.4% Sémillon carries itself with grace and style. The dense fruit flavors mix peaches, apricots, pears and spicy apples; with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Though quite dry, it has so much fruit as to seem lightly sweet, and the high alcohol does not take away from the complexity. If it were not fermented dry, this would be a stunning late harvest dessert wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a bright, buoyant style of Brunello that drinks easily but also delivers the sophistication and complexity you should expect of Montalcino. It opens with crisp, tonic aromas of cassis and wild berry with very subtle aromas of vanilla and toasted nut at the back. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A pale pink color introduces this wine, as do fairly weak aromas of bubble gum and freshly squeezed lime. This is one of three rosés made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate. It would be a great match for anything rich in texture but light in flavor, as it could be easily overwhelmed. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aged only in stainless steel to preserve its fresh, clean flavors, this expression of Favorita (a little-known white wine grape from northern Italy) offers lively tones of lemon zest, white blossom and cut grass. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"If pink could have a taste, this is the wine. From hand-picked 100% Cabernet Franc, it is all about bright fruit and red berries. Soft with touches of caramel, it delivers good acidity at the end. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A first-class Cabernet, this is dry, richly tannic and mouthwateringly tart in acidity. It shows savory blackberry and cherry flavors, while the oak gives it an umami tang of smoke. Drink now-2016. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The aromas seem quite dried out, with notes of fruit leather, medicine cabinet and green herbs. The palate brings more of the same, seeming more advanced than its age might indicate. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Size marks this wine. It's huge in flavor, swamping the palate with black and red cherries, pomegranates, sweet rhubarb pie, coffee and vanilla. At the same time, it's fairly light in color, and certainly light and silky in body, with crisp acids. Shows enough complexity to serve with your finest entrées. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A bit raw and rustic in texture, with a briary, green peppercorn mouthfeel that's scoury and tart in acids. Couple that with berry-cherry fruit, and you can a Zin that tastes sweet-and-sour. But it's very Zinny, and will wash down barbecue with ease. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together. Give it until 2012, and it should develop bottle complexity for another 5–6 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Thick and soft, this wine has simple, sweetish medicinal flavors of cherry and black raspberry Lifesavers. The oak just adds vanilla. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A big, fat wine that lives up to the popular image of Meursault. Perhaps it could do with a little more depth of flavor, but it's a ripe glassful of Chardonnay now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Very ripe, with sun-enriched blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, and rich in sweet, dusty tannins. The finish on this polished, gentle Cab is a little sweet and oaky. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Jammy and fresh, with ripe, rich fruit. Apricot, Fig Newton, peach cobbler, crème caramel, honey, vanilla and toast flavors all mingle into a complex, spicy finish. The price of dryness is high alcohol, but the wine never tastes hot. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Birch Creek Vineyard provides the fruit for this stainless-steel-fermented and aged wine. It offers notes of custard, lees and herbs. The clover flavors show a richer feel but the concentration doesn't all seem to be there, trailing toward the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A rich, ripe and complex Cabernet, with classic Napa tannic structure. Not quite up there with the winery's higher-priced Dollarhide or Elu bottlings, but showing similar elegance and taste. Brims with blueberry, mocha and cedar flavors that should develop over the next four years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dull and dusty on the nose, this burly Zin opens up in the glass, offering a slight sweetness of blackberry and vanilla amid its soft texture and structure. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made from equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this wine was aged on the lees for more than four years, which gives it a fabulous creamy, yeasty complexity. There are tantalizing flavors of limes, orange zest, roasted hazelnuts, minerals and smoke. Absolutely wonderful now, and should hold and develop in the bottle through 2014, at least. Only 563 cases produced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Heavy and dark in color, this is stalky on the nose, with a compost component that doesn't scream “fresh and ready.” It feels fairly snappy, but it tastes tart and slightly vegetal before finishing with rhubarb flavors. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Made with southern Italy's most noble white grape, this structured wine conveys subtle aromas of white and yellow spring flowers accented by whiffs of beeswax and slate. The juicy palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit and mineral alongside fresh acidity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine gives a clear, clean shot of pure raspberry fruit, lightly dusted with coffee and cocoa. A whiff of smoke drifts across the finish as the wine quickly thins out. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a winery founded at the start of the 1900s that has morphed over the decades to enthusiastically embrace modern use of oak. In fact, the wood here is almost too much of a good thing with carpentry and cedar notes that mask much of the cherry fruit. In the mouth, it has a chewy texture, smoke favors and a spice-driven finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Generous and rounded, this wine combines the opulence of Volnay with a strongly tannic character coming from the old vines. Together, it's a rich, fruit-filled wine that is backed by a dry core and fragrant red berry acidity. Drink from 2018. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"You can almost smell the minerals and acids in this Chardonnay. The flavors verify the aroma, adding fruitier notes of limes, sweet apples and white peaches, complexed with the creamy, smoky nuances of new oak and sur lies aging. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An unusual blend of 80% Clairette and 20% Bourboulenc, this medium-bodied wine is crisp and citrusy, marked by pineapple and hints of underripe peach and pear. It's light enough to be paired with more delicate seafood dishes over the summer months. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A very tasty wine, loaded with fleshy, fruity flavor. The dominant note is fresh cut pear, dappled with cinnamon spice. Round and balanced, it's a delicious bottle with just a slight hint of residual sweetness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There's a tight, tannic coarseness to this Petite Sirah that makes it a little bitter and difficult. On the other hand, it's elegantly structured, with a rich core of blackberries. This suggests ageability, it could improve in the bottle. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this is a rich, softly tannic and delicious wine. It brims with jammy blackberry, dark chocolate and sweet cedar flavors, in a sweetly chewy texture that hints at further ageability. Drink now–2015. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The most tannic and closed of Vine Cliff's magnificent array of '07 Cabernets. It's hard, with a bite of acidity, but it doesn't take much for the richness to explode. Blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, butterscotch, sweet cinnamon spice, the list goes on and on. So rich and decadent, you can enjoy it now, but it will gather momentum over the next 6–8 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This needs air to show its best, because at first it's tight, mulchy and nutty. Early on, it feels clampy and scratchy, but it becomes better as it airs. The black fruit flavors are touched up by notes of oak, dried cheese and leather—characteristics that extend onto the finish. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"The winery's most popular wine, Cali is 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot and 4% Sangiovese. Nice aromatics lead into a medium-bodied wine with bright spices, strawberry preserves, some sour plum, and defining acidity, with a lick of chocolate in the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A ripe, soft, nut- and pear-flavored wine, with fresh acidity. It is smooth, velvet in texture, with some apple juice freshness on the finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is a light and easy Prosecco Extra Dry with notes that recall cut grass and hay. There's not much in the way of flower or fruit aromas, although there is a hint of ripe banana and cardboard. It's tonic and lean with crisp freshness on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This Clerc-Milon, under the same winemaking team as Mouton Rothschild, is an attractive wine, not heavy, already quite soft. It seems to have been heavily extracted, in a New World style, with new wood aromas and flavors, losing something of Pauillac, but a winner in that it's immediately attractive. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Give this tough, young Cabernet a good long decant before serving. At first, it's dominated by sharp acidity and mouth-numbing tannins. But after some airing, it offers black currant flavors. This is likely not an ager. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution? Probably, because the tannins promise aging and the intensely aromatic nature of the fruit points to a potentially fine wine. Just don't drink it yet. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Rooty and earthy smelling, this has aromas of leather, cassis, tobacco, dried cheese and cola. It feels rich and nicely textured, with firm but friendly tannins that set up tobacco, coffee, mocha and roasted berry flavors. It's chocolaty in an uncanny way on the finish. Drink now through 2018. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"The dilute, grapey flavors are candied, and a pile of charred lumber doesn't make them go down any easier. A simple wood-and-juice quaff. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"In 2003 the vineyard was going through some changes, and the vintage, the shift in focus and the winemaker's predilection for early picking seemed to conspire to produce a rather thin, austere wine. It's locked up tight, a bit herbal and lean, not yet revealing itself even with aeration. It's one of those mystery wines that you keep coming back to, waiting for the light to blink on. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This 100% Syrah shows intense blackberry, crème de cassis and plum sauce flavors, plus hints of charred bone and black pepper. It's dry, and the tannins are firm but supple. The alcohol is high, but it's balanced with the wine's fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dry and savory, this blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier has a tangy spine of minerality that frames lusher notes of papaya, white peach, lemon zest, nectarine and vanilla. Finishes with a refreshing touch of citrusy acids. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a soft, broadly fruity Chardonnay, with near-tropical ripeness. Banana and papaya flavors dominate, accented by pretty baking spices and a touch of mineral. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A pear, apple-orange and earth bouquet sets the stage for a palate chockful of pineapple, pear and lemon flavor. Toast notes offset and vibrant acidity uplifts the fruit nicely. The finish is long and tart-sweet with complex leesy, earthy notes. Medium-bodied and restrained, this complex wine shows depth. Give it six months to a year to unfold. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Earthy aromas of brick dust blend with spiced cherry and tomato notes. A chewy, solid palate registers as correct, while this tastes of ripe, candied berry fruits and chocolate. A long, warm, slightly oaky finish sends this on its way. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew. Big and a bit clumsy in the mouth, more vibrancy and freshness is needed to keep things in better balance. However, if you like 'em sweeter, this one's for you. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This tart and aromatic white blend could be labeled Chardonnay; less than a quarter is a mix of Riesling, Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Gris. It's detailed and lively, with bright citrus, pineapple, pink grapefruit and sweet spice. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This has a soapy mouthfeel, often an indicator for a high pH wine. The apple and pear fruit flavors are mild but thin. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With this wine, Venge has taken a giant leap into the front ranks of California Syrah producers. It's made from fruit that's sourced from the great Stagecoach Vineyard, which straddles Atlas Peak—a cool mountain region. The acidity is preserved, and the concentrated fruit easily handles the 60% new French oak. Dramatic and high in alcohol, this selection is gorgeous to drink now, and it will remain fresh over the next six years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fruity, soft and candied, this high alcohol wine has blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with a rustic texture. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a few other varieties. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a very informal and easygoing red table wine that would taste great with pizza. It opens with a bright ruby color and shows aromas of cherry, raspberry and toasted almond. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The bouquet is marked by a steady stream of bright raspberry, rose, wild berry and bitter almond. It's sassy crispness on the finish should pair well with cheese or mayonnaise-based appetizers. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is made using a selection of fruit that's sourced from both banks of the Serein River. It's a properly crisp Chardonnay, and it offers a white fruit flavor and a bright, lively finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Another lovely Gewurz from Navarro. Made with neutral oak fermentation, it's rich and crisp and spicy, with a mélange of exotic fruit and wildflower flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Thin and watery, with diluted citrus flavors and lots of raw acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"It's incredibly rich and ripe in blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate, with a lovely veneer of toasted oak. The tannins are super smooth. Drink now–2020. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Polished and creamy, this is made to appeal to the popular style. It's rich and ripe in tangerine, apricot and lime fruit, with toasty, vanilla overtones. Brightened by crisp acidity, it's a lovely wine to drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"We suggest very little time with this bulky, medicinal Tempranillo. Despite color and weight, it's prickly, sour and not too ripe. The flavors and finish are short, while the overriding impression is that it's underdeveloped. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Like the regular Chardonnay, Beuna Vista's regular Pinot Noir is a medium-bodied, easy-drinking version of the variety. There's enough herbal complexity to keep it interesting, but the cherry-tinged fruit is ripe and the tannins supple. Finishes with a burst of crisp acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Cherry and vanilla are this ripasso's most prominent aromas but if you dig deep you will uncover Spanish cedar, blueberry tart, maple syrup and Indian spice. The wine has a bright personality and offers loads of ripe fruit in the mouth. Imported by Solstars Inc. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Light berry fruit, alcohol around 13%, a pale color, and plenty of acidity characterize this Pinot Noir. Still tightly wound, it may add some flesh with further bottle age. The aromas hint at tomato leaf, and the wine fades gently. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This firm, dry wine is all tannins and bitter extraction. It has a hard side to it that the juicy fruit cannot balance. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A dark, rich, ripe Syrah that defines the California style, and preserves the fine structure that this cool-climate region lends to red wines. The wine is dry and tannic, and the flavors, of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak, are just delicious. Now and for a few years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fresh and jammy, with sharp acidity and berry flavors that taste right out of the fermenter. Seems like it was released awfully young, but might calm down in a few months. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past. The thyme and rosemary streak continues into and through the finish, while the fruit maintains its power and polish, with just the lightest barrel influence perceptible in a kiss of toast. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This opens has a bold appearance with dark extraction. The aromas that follow are reminiscent of ripe cherry, cinnamon spice, plum and pulpy black fruit. Round and soft, this closes with firm grittiness. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine seems barely ripe, with thin, herbal, almost vegetal flavors and a sour streak. The barrel aging may have contributed some suggestions of vanilla and licorice. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An unusually deep color and black-cherry flavors help make this wine concentrated and full bodied. A thick layer of tannins puckers the mouth, but will help the wine pair with a roast or rich risotto. It's made from 76% Grenache and 24% Syrah. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This solidly structured wine shows the firm tannins and mineral structure typical of wines from Côte du Py. It has dense black cherry fruits along with sacidity that cuts through the structure. It could age another year, but is worth drinking now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine's fruit is sourced entirely from the Conner Lee Vineyard. The superjuicy black-cherry flavor is balanced by generous acidity. Vibrant and full, long and fresh, this could age gracefully for a decade or more. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Each year this value red blend is surprisingly different. With Syrah as the main component, it's spicier, more sappy and loaded with bright and forward berry flavors. The Bordeaux grapes that fill in the second half of the blend add notes of herb, earth, leaf and a hint of stone. It's a delicious, fine value. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Wild Horse captures the essence of Central Coast Pinot. The wine isn't especially complex or ageable, but defines the fruit and acid balance of the region. Cherries, black raspberries, root beer and spiced rum punch are the flavors, and the wine is silky and dry. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Bone dry with aromas of freshly pressed apples, this is an austere but elegant sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. With notes of delicate white florals and yeast in the backdrop, the palate has a savory, dusty quality accented by a racy acidity and strong, minerally finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ripe fruit notes of black cherry and raspberry are followed by chocolate and delicate spice. This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot from Maremma, Tuscany is sharp and well-focused in the mouth with lingering tones of ripe fruit and a crisp berry finale. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Excellent color on this firmly fruity wine. It has an attractive edge of tannins giving it good structure while showing all of the fresh nouveau fruit. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"A bit vegetal, and a bit sweet on the finish in pineapple candy. Not particularly successful. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Bone dry, but sharp and harsh in texture, with some minty flavors next to the black cherries. Okay for an everyday sipper with casual foods. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched soil, overripe plum, leather and a funky whiff of farmyard. On the palate, notes of game, clove and sage join raw red cherry offset by bracing tannins. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Terre di Sofia is an oak-aged Chardonnay, with lemon zest, vanilla, exotic fruit, pineapple and light shadings of exotic spice. It's smooth and supple in the mouth. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The '04 Reserve Cab Franc was a very good wine. This one is much different, rustic and simple, with stewed cherry flavors and a bitter finish. Okay for everyday fare. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Without a doubt one of the most successful vineyard crus in Barbaresco, Rabajà delivers unique intensity and sophistication. You'll notice aromas of black fruit, spice, tar and licorice and there's good balance between the wine's acidity and its tannic structure. Pair this wine with roasted pork stuffed with prunes. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Dark, thick with tannins, a sturdy wine with plenty of fleshy blackberry and coffee flavors. Bone dry, and can probably age for a few years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here is a beautifully extracted and voluptuous Barolo from the Cannubi cru that would pair with tender veal shank, slow cooked until falling off the bone. Black cherry, spice, root beer and fragrant earthy tones all appear on the nose and the wine closes with tight, firm structure. Cellar age ten years or more. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Entirely off the estate, this polished young Pinot offers a complex mélange of flavors, in a balanced structure. The tastes of root beer, red currants, licorice, gingersnap cookie and sweet oak are frankly delicious. Fine now, and should peak by 2010, then hold for several more years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Violet, plum, leather and baking spice aromas merge on this easygoing red. The no-fuss palate offers black cherry, star anise and a hint of clove alongside polished but rather fleeting tannins. Drink soon. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A very nice Syrah, dark and dry and full-bodied. Although it's a bit young and thick in jammy, primary fruit flavors, it's smooth and balanced. With rich blackberry pie, chocolate, violet, beef carpaccio, bacon and pepper flavors, it should develop through 2011. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Soft, slightly sweet and simple, this Syrah has fairly modest blackberry, licorice flavors and cola flavors. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Soft and rich with pineapple, lemon candy and oak flavors, this simple Chardonnay has the benefit of acidity for balance. It's a nice, basic Chard at an everyday price. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Has all the hallmarks of Viognier, namely lots of tropical fruit, wildflower, vanilla and spicy aromas and flavors, and finishes thoroughly dry. Could use more brightness and zest, though, as it's a bit flat. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"As rich as it is, this is a somewhat generic Cabernet. It's ripe and fruity and oaky, with appealing blackberry, currant and smoky wood flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. With a sweet finish, it's flashy, if not particularly complex or ageworthy. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"With 6 Rhône varieties, including Viognier, this is a fresh, fruity wine meant to be consumed within the next five years. It's strong in cherry, blackberry and other berry flavors, with the smoky vanilla of oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Obviously not in the first flush of youth, this dry rosé goes more for mature almond marzipan along with cranberry juice flavors to give some tightness to the texture. Definitely to be drunk now. Screwcap. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Good color, but the very light cranberry fruit flavors have a strong mint streak running down the core of this wine. It's hard to find varietal character here; it's thin, herbal and a bit hard-edged. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Belle Vallée has made a nouveau-style Pinot Noir, very forward with light fruit flavors of strawberry candy. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This range of wines comes from different regions of the southwest. The white comes from Gascony and is typical local blend. It is crisp and fruity with a soft texture from the ripe Colombard. There is a light dancing character to this lively, fruity wine. Drink now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A tightly structured wine marked by apple and peach flavors, but there's a young earthiness that keeps it from being a mere fruit-fest. Lush, creamy and complex, with real density and weight. Lots to like here. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smells like ripe peaches with hints of anise and almond. Tastes similar, with a plump mouthfeel that carries the flavors across the palate to a short but pleasant finish. Nice as an apéritif, or with mildly flavored fish or poultry. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"These “Original Vines” are in fact the oldest Pinot Gris vines in the country. They deliver exquisite details of earth and stone around a solid core of apple and Asian pear. It's bone dry, with exceptional depth. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The mildly floral nose leads to a lean and acidic palate, with flavors of lemon and green apple. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Lead pencil and hints of gravel come from Red Mountain fruit, with some of the welcome funk and grit in place from the Boushey Vineyard. Lovely aromas suggest violets and white pepper and hints of smoky chocolate. Smooth, tart, tasting of cherry and berry. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A good Pinot that shows a fine coastal influence. Dry and silky, it displays flavors of ripe cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice and sandalwood, with a cinnamon and pepper flourish. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There's good Santa Barbara character in this Chardonnay, with brisk acidity and minerality girding the tropical fruit and peach flavors. It's a little thin, but elegantly structured. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Soft and round, with an explosive burst of candied fruit on the palate, this Barbera has concentrated flavors of dried cherry, plum and milk chocolate, the latter of which pops on the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A hearty Cabernet rich in cranberry and cassis with streaks of earthy cedar and a pleasant herbal undertone. The tannins are young still, pleading to wait until 2017–2019 in the bottle, or for some air before enjoying. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aalto is one of several smaller projects being led by former Vega Sicilia head winemaker Mariano García, and we think this 2001 Pagos Seliccionados (PS) is his best effort to date. The wine is dark, with charcoal, lemon and pure black-fruit aromas. It features a brilliant luster and deep, rich, syrupy flavors of maple, boysenberry and black cherry. Shows a beautiful finish and amazing depth. Hold until 2006–07. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Shows good Syrah character, a rich, spicy, full-bodied wine with luscious flavors of blackberries, black cherries, figs and tangerine zest. There's also a tangy minerality that gives the wine backbone and verve. Shows the promise of this mountainous Lake County appellation. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A nice, slightly sweet white wine, with tropical fruit, buttered toast, white flower and vanilla flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail sipper. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A slightly copperish hue suggests this wine has been made according to Pinot Grigio tradition (in which the wine sees longer contact with the skins). You'll get aromas of peach, nectarine, and honeysuckle followed by a crisp-clean mouthfeel. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Amador Foothill does a good job with Sangiovese, and this dry rosé is made from that variety. It's a cheerful wine, brisk in acidity and with delicate but complex cherry, rose petal and lavender flavors. The winemaker recommends bouillabaisse, which is a pretty good suggestion. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The most notable thing about this Pinot is its intensity of flavor. A blend of both new Dijon clones and older California selections of Pinot Noir, it is stunning with flavors of raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper. It's a balanced, elegant wine with vibrant texture , but needs time to truly shine. Hold till at least 2017. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"D'Alessandro's plump Syrah is a bold and generous red wine, with richly layered aromas of cherry, blackberry, rum cake, bacon fat and toasted nut. Pair this wine with abbacchio arrosto (roast lamb). ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"It opens with aromas of forest floor, porcini mushroom and espresso. The straightforward palate offers bright berry, coffee and grilled herbs alongside firm tannins. Drink 2015–2020. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon make a warm, blend that is full, herbal and concentrated with black fruits and dark tannins. Spice provides a reminder that this wine comes from a warm climate. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2016. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Eric Hamacher has done a fine job with this wine. At 13.6% alcohol it is in fine balance, with a precise mix of strawberry, pie cherry, root beer and herb flavors. It's medium bodied, open and accessible, but not too simple. There is no reason to wait, but it could be cellared for up to six years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Le Focaie is a great value wine with easy but one-dimensional fruit characteristics of cherry, blackberry and cinnamon spice. The wine's natural thickness and consistency recalls the sunniest vineyards of southern Tuscany. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A rich Chardonnay, with plenty to offer. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth, with dry flavors of citrus, tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast, and brisk, clean acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, with pretty, ripe berry and plum fruit flavors in abundance. The toasty frame, medium tannins and hints of dried leaf add to the overall composition of this nicely-balanced, limited-production wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Earthy, spicy aromas lead, rolling into smoky layers of typical Cab flavors. Berry, tobacco and touches of sweet oak give it okay complexity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Heavy and sweet, this wine has melted cherry-jam and Dr. Pepper flavors and some heat from the alcohol. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Soft and sweetly fruity, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, plums and cherries, spiced with anise and cinnamon. Easy to like. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A rich, but mineral driven wine, with flavors of quince, citrus and green herbs. This is young but over 2–3 years it will develop into a richer, smoother wine. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A monstrous mix of Mourvèdre (89%) and Syrah (11%) from Calaveras's Dalton Vineyard, Twisted Oak's River of Skulls opens with a heady nose of bright cherry, black tea and candied dark plum and shows off bright acidity for such a pleasantly plump wine. Tannins are resolved and yet rightfully there. The long finish is enveloped in raspberry flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Exotic and complex, this medium-bodied, structured wine is awash with aromas, from charcuterie and mixed nut to cedar and pencil. Anchoring it is a dusty tannic profile and a punch of oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is the kind of wine that will be wildly popular as a cocktail sipper. It has the fruit, spice and oaky vanilla to appeal to almost all palates, yet is dry and crisp in acidity, leaving behind a clean, fruity finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Helped by extra bottle age, this Syrah is the best of the latest releases from Cliff Creek. Balanced and varietal, its spicy berry fruit is highlighted with grapefruity phenolics. Flavors penetrate and stand up well into a medium-long, balanced finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smooth and ripe, this Bordeaux blend pleases for its rich array of blackberry, cherry and spicy plum flavors. The texture is soft and chocolaty. Loses a point or two for the sugary finish, though. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Tastes sweet, with cherry and blackberry jelly flavors, but racy and clean in acidity, like a simple, by-the-glass wine at a fast food restaurant. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Another successful 2011 from this winery, in fact the best of their six new Pinots. Shows the brilliant acidity and light, delicate texture of the coast, with the concentrated fruit, cola and spice flavors this esteemed vineyard is noted for. Highly complex and dry, it's delicious to drink now, and should age well for a good six years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is bizarrely perfumed: It tastes like a candy shop smells, with a note of fruit jelly. The tannins are taut, but the wine doesn't hang together. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Oak dominates the overall character of this wine, with forward notes of toasted wood, tobacco leaf, roasted coffee bean and a hint of plum. There's more wood than fruit here. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This quite tart, young and spicy red pulls sharp and puckery cranberry fruit into focus. It's best enjoyed chilled, and would be a fine option for the base of a wine punch. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is light and generic, the sort of low-priced Merlot that California cranks out by the boatload. Washington can do better. There's a spiffy new label, but where's the beef? ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A light, entry-level red, with fresh berry aromas and a touch of dried herbs. Dry, but with an appealing softness to its texture. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"New, eco-friendly minimalist packaging and estate-grown fruit push this distinctive Walla Walla Valley Syrah to the front ranks. Juicy, sappy, tart and tangy boysenberry fruit flavors run through the bright midpalate. Tannins are soft and supple, with plenty of lemony acidity backing them up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a dry Chardonnay marked by pronounced acids and steely minerals. The underlying flavors are of exotic pineapples and guavas, while new oak and lees aging add richer notes of buttered toast and sour cream. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Coming from such a cool climate, this Cab isn't as opulent or ripe as, say, Napa. There's a wintergreen mint note alongside the sweet red cherry and black raspberry flavors, and a lightly elegant weight. It's a different kind of Cab, but a dry, good one, and very friendly with food. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of brandied cherry, crushed violet black pepper and a whiff of exotic spice lead the way. The round palate doles out dried plum, raisin, nutmeg, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2016–2021. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This smells stalky and leafy, with a baked element. It shows tomato-driven acidity and red-leaning flavors of cranberry, tomato and raspberry that are touched up by notes of oak-based vanilla and dill. Tomato and tobacco flavors are key to the finish. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Michel Laroche has been branching out of Chablis in recent years and his southern French effort has some chlorine notes along with aromas of mint and sweet wood. The power is up there, but there isn't suppleness to match. The palate pulsates while the finish is dark and sharp, with a burnt flavor. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Clean and polished, this Chardonnay opens with very subtle tones of vanilla, peach and passion fruit. There's just enough structure to create rich, creamy sensations. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Dark fruits—notably black cherries and figs—come with a chocolaty edge. The citrusy acids keep the wine on point as it slowly fades. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Intense blueberry and blackberry notes penetrate through this fruity, forward Pinot Noir. Hints of savory herbs add elegance to an otherwise one-dimensional palate that finishes with big, coarse tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Riper than you usually get from this Salinas Valley appellation, and more pleasing. It's rich in blackberries, cherries, plums and herbs, with a dry, spicy finish and firm tannins. Good value. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This delicate Pinot Noir provides plenty of drinking pleasure, but it's not without limitations. Chief among them is a hint of raw, dank mushroom. It's not strong, but just enough to weigh down the raspberries and cherries. Drink it by 2016. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Green vegetable aromas mingle with fresh kiwi and lime and a touch of pepper and salt. The wine is going through the sort of closed-up phase common with Chenin Blanc, the fruits just a hint, the texture smooth. Give it another 3–4 years, and the fruits will come together with mature almond flavors. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"The softness and rusticity that almost always mark Sierra Foothills wines are here, yet the wine rises to what might be called coastal elegance. A Spanifornia blend of Tempranillo and Cab Sauvignon, it has a complexity that unfolds in waves of blackberry, tobacco, clove, anise and espresso. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Juicy and round, this opens with scents of honeysuckle, yellow stone fruit and a hint of aromatic herb. The full-bodied palate offers ripe white peach, pear and a hint of candied lemon drop while a mineral note backs up the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A beautiful Chardonnay, notable for its elegant structure. Perfect acidity and just a hint of tannins, much of it from oak barrels, provide the framework for the pineapple and kiwi fruit flavors, enriched with notes of cream and buttered toast. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Veneered with oak, the nose bears strong aromas of carpenter's shop and charred sugar, with notes of dark stone fruit and cranberry sauce lingering beneath. While initially soft and syrupy, the midpalate gains some tannic traction. Raw meat and blackberry flavors mark the juicy finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From a dry-farmed vineyard and treated to wild yeast and minimal new French oak, this Petite is chewy in leathery tannins, a definite crowd pleaser for Petite fans. Blackberries, coffee and pepper commingle impressively. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this is the most elegant and delicate of the winery's current bubblies. It's a dry, sophisticated wine, with subtle citrus, peach, apple and yeast flavors. If you've never cellared a sparkling wine, try stashing this away for up to a decade. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a pale and luminous rosé from Southern Italy with a pinkish-peach color and delicate aromas of stone fruit, wild berries, white cherries and a touch of chopped mint or basil. The wine is tart but also slightly sweet in the mouth and there's a touch of bitter almond on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way. The tannins, oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries, pomegranates, cola, tangerine, vanilla and spices, giving the wine a silky, complex, mellow mouthfeel. Beautifully dry and lush now, and should develop through 2012. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Il Puro is a simple but genuine expression of Merlot with soft cherry nuances backed by light shadings of spice and mineral. The texture is smooth and silky, and although this is a very simple wine, it does deliver easy drinking pleasure. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The Chelan region is Washington's newest AVA, but already showing great potential for Syrah, as this aromatic and explosively flavorful bottle proves. Ripe berries, plums and cherries are swept into a mix of smoke and rock and iron filings; as you taste through the wine there are citrusy acids and hints of resin and tar; it just keeps adding in the nuances. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"For an $18 Oregon Pinot, you can't do much better than this well-made wine from a top-flight vintage. Brambly black cherry fruit carries a streak of cola, with ripe, moderate tannins balancing out a medium-long finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet. Dramatic in structure and flavor, with massively packed blackberries, dark chocolate and pain grillé. The wine was aged in 49% new oak, which adds smoky, spice overtones. Drink now and through 2013. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The dryness and low alcohol are praiseworthy, but more challenging are hard tannins and biting acidity. With blackberry and sweet green-herb flavors, it's the opposite of today's ripe cult style, but by no means unattractive. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is an ultrarich, ripe Cabernet, marked by jammy blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, with a milk chocolate sweetness and soft, intricate tannins. Made in the soft, modern style, it's best over the next six years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a bold, densely structured wine with vanilla-cream, orange-soda and pineapple-custard flavors. There's good acidity, but it appeals to the modern style with it's ripe, straightforward feel. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With 14 months' new wood aging, this wine is still all wood and toast. The wine does have weight, with the promise of blackberry fruits under the firm tannins. It is finely structured and should mature well. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Cherry, berry and herb flavors are buried inside bigtime tannins that numb the palate, in this dry, smoothly textured wine. It's questionable whether the wine has enough stuffing for the cellar. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There's sweet dark cherry and plum fruit here, but to get to it you need to give the sulfur on the nose time to blow off. When it does, the wait is worth it. A full, lush mouthfeel caresses your palate, and the finish is dry and even. Decant if drinking now, or wait a year or two. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Made from organically farmed grapes, this offers tropical and white stone fruit aromas. On the bright palate, a saline hint underscores yellow apple, Bartlett pear and citrus fruit. It finishes clean and crisp. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Very dry and a little earthy, with a dusty hay or dried straw quality to the tangerine, sweet lime, lychee, peaches and cream flavors. An interesting, crisp Chard with plenty of nuanced complexity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Firm, a bit astringent and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, black cherries and cedar. A solid Cabernet with some raw edges that might age out in a few years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A little simple and easy, but there's a wealth of raspberry, strawberry and floral notes in this delicate wine. It's a bit too sweet for my tastes, although it does have good acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is the winery's flagship red; in this vintage it's 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Syrah. Sturdy and structured to age, the Syrah component pops in the pepper and spice, while the Cab and Merlot give it muscle and verve. Youthful, lovely floral notes and pure, pretty berry fruits shine in this ripe but graceful wine with sweet fruit, a pleasing midpalate and a clean and textural finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Crisp and refreshing with notes of grated ginger, white flowers and cantaloupe. This dry Riesling balances peachy fruit flavors with a steely backbone of slate and lime, tart acidity and a pleasantly long finish. Lovely all around. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Terre di Maria is a Sicilian blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Pinot Noir that opens with dark concentration and savory aromas of spice, cured meat, smoked bacon and dark berry fruit. The bouquet is slightly muddled but the mouthfeel is bright and fresh. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Lemon and Anjou pear take the lead in this easy-drinking white, with secondary hints of faint toast and citrus rind adding depth and interest. It's balanced but there's a slight sharpness to the finish with a slightly pithy bitterness. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Crisp, light and redolent of red apple and forest berry, this wine should pair with fried chicken or easy pasta dishes. There's a sharp bitter berry note on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"If you like 'em big and oaky, then this one's for you. Aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, roasted red apples, buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound. The mouth is full and slightly fat, with moderate acidity and a medium-length, smoky finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Quite a distinguished '99, with its flamboyant aromas of spicy blackcurrants and cassis, with an oaky overlay of smoke and vanilla. Feels good as soon as it hits the palate, with blackberry flavors that last through the finish. The jolt of dry tannins that makes the palate puckery suggests midterm aging. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Absolutely easy to drink, a soft, silky wine with pleasantly ripe berry and cherry flavors. Has a rich Asian spiciness throughout, and is dry and balanced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a generic red wine. It's soft, with berry and coffee flavors and a scour of tannins on the finish, and dryish overall. Versatile with a wide range of things. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smokey tones of charcoal and dark granite or slate rise from the nose of this Lazio-based Petit Verdot. Dusty mineral notes are followed by dark, ripe fruit and the wine is long-lasting and penetrating on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Estimating the ageability of a Pinot Noir can be tricky. This one, with hefty tannins, brisk acidity and loads of fresh primary fruit, seems to be ageworthy. Give it 5-6 years to let the structural elements begin to resolve and for the flavors of blackberry jam, Chinese tea, mushroom and spice to develop secondary characteristics. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rusciano is a blend of Syrah and Nero d'Avola that displays impressive depth and complexity. Aromas of dark fruit, spice, black currant and earthy tobacco build in intensity as the wine evolves in the glass. The finish is smooth and rich. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Very rich, with bounteous flavors of crushed ripe blackberries, blueberries, dill, black pepper and dark chocolate, with firm, furry tannins. A bit bitter now, and might age for a couple years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Kind of overripe in raisins and prunes, which detracts for me, but it's dry, with a chocolate and cassis finish that flatters the palate. The tannins are soft and sweet. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"As much as we like the retro package, this time the contents are just too one-dimensional. The heavily toasted oak over the narrow fruit from the '98 vintage reads as just that—toast, with vanilla and coconut shadings. Dry powdery tannins mark the taut finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Branded Bordeaux has a deservedly spotty reputation, but this year's Mouton Cadet aims to start turning that around. Cherries and chocolate on the nose, followed by smoky, earthy tobacco and black-cherry flavors. A silky texture makes it ready to drink now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Always a very dry, elegant Pinot Noir, Signorello's '08 Las Amigas again displays those qualities. It shows dried raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, with a distinct minerality and a dusting of tobacco and black pepper. This fancy Pinot is a natural lamb or steak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An interesting wine you can call intellectual. Its appeal is as much conceptual as hedonistic. It's the opposite of today's soft, sweet fruit bombs, being bone dry and somewhat austere, showing a tightly knit tannic structure. With an explosive, but controlled, central core of blackberries, it's a cellar candidate. It will be fascinating to try this wine after 2014. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc, fermented and aged in stainless steel. Shows rich, savory citrus and green grass flavors, with hints of minerals and flowers. Very drinkable and bone-dry. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of raw oak, cinnamon, bacon and clove outmuscle fruit on this rough, tannic, scraping 2013. Flavors of toast, chocolate and baking spices push blackberry and black-plum fruit towards an oaky, abrasive finish with rocky tannins and accents of chocolate and cinnamon. Holding this for another couple of years may or may not soften this fierce but tasty RDD. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Made from four Rhône varieties dominated by Mourvèdre and Syrah, but this blend is solidly warm-climate California. Bursts with jammy cherry, blackberry and spice flavors that finish a little sweet and simple. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Full and round, with snappy acidity that brings life and lift to the luscious fruit, this delicious wine is aimed at those who like a festival of green and yellow fruits in their glass. It has fine texture and length, with a defining mineral streak that elevates this well beyond just fruity. It has medium-term aging potential as well. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Without showing the richness of prior vintages, this year's bottling is earthy and crisp and very dry. It has a steely minerality and modest fruit that suggests green apples and pineapples. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Massively rich and ripe with blackberry jam, chocolate, anise and spice flavors, this Zin doesn't leave much to the imagination. You can taste the California sunshine and heat in every potent sip. The alcohol is very high, yet the wine wears it well. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A rich Riesling, just off dry, balancing intense acidity with white currant, hedgerow fruits and a concentrated texture. The wine is full-bodied, very ripe and superbly structured. Very fruity now, this is a wine to show how well Riesling can age—give it 6–8 years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is a new winery for me, and it's a promising start. The wine is decadently rich in cassis, cherries, milk chocolate and vanilla flavors, but it has the structural integrity of a fine wine. While acidity is soft, the tannins have the grip of cherry skins, while oak adds its own tannic complexities. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Generous and opulent, this is a wood-aged wine in which the fruit plays a delicious part. Blackberry juice and acidity play counterpoint to toasty wood flavors and dark tannins. There is a fine, toasty aftertaste that promises good aging. Drink from 2015. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Given its modest price and weighty alcohol, this wine should find many admirers. Thick and tannic, it could pass for a heavier red than Pinot Noir, and it offers bulky, rustic fruit flavors, with some heat on the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The term Vintner's Select, which is unregulated, can be abused. Here it really means something, as this is the winery's top cuvée—an excellent effort that spent 18 months in oak. There's extra depth in the cherry and cassis fruit, packing a powerful, compact punch all the way through a long, polished finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Power characterizes this Bordeaux blend, which is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. It's strong in primary fruit, showcasing blackberries, black cherries, plums, carob and cola, and also strong in tannins, with a brisk, scoury mouthfeel. Add dryness, and you have a young, fresh wine of some charm and limited ageability. Now, with decanting, and through 2013. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Firm and muscular, this delivers powerful, concentrated red currant, cherry and berry fruit, tightly wrapped and resonant. Young and compact, the wine just begins to hint at the complexity it contains, with notes of herb, leaf and barrel spice. Good weight and concentration, plus exceptional length and precision. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A beautiful copper color, deep and dense. Modeled on the wines of Provence's Domaines Ott, this rosé was designed, says the winemaker, to age. It's whole-cluster fermented from Grenache vines that have been picked and grown specifically to be a rosé—not a saignée. Compact, compressed and powerful with an emphasis on the mineral subtext, light peach and strawberry highlights. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Roasted plum and raspberry aromas offer accents of vanilla, dill and dry wood. The palate is big, a little soft and chubby in the middle, with savory, herbal black fruit flavors that are meaty and deep. Finishes earthy, herbal and with integrity. This is Monastrell that's ready to go. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"The opening is attractive, with mocha, raspberry and carob scents but it turns a bit tart in the mouth. Rustic tannins provide a backdrop for the char and vanilla flavors of the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is what might be called old-style Washington Cabernet. The fruit is mixed liberally with bell pepper and dill; there is plenty of tannin and a distinctly earthy aroma of the barnyard that carries well into the finish. For some, it will be pleasantly reminiscent of cru Bourgeois Bordeaux. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A collaboration between Sonoma County-based winemaker Jesse Katz and Ken Forrester of South Africa, this 100% varietal red is robust and rich. Dark cherry, red currant and integrated oak flavors support its bold body. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A good, dry, elegant wine, fully ready to drink now with a nice steak. It's a complex Merlot, with layers of black cherries, licorice, cola and spices, as well as a pleasant touch of smoky oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"I drank this at the end of a long, hot summer day, which is when a cold, crisp white is at its best. What a delicious wine. Bold citrus and apricot flavors, acids so strong they almost fizz and a rich creaminess even though there's no oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Nice and ripely sweet in fresh blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this Syrah is made for drinking now. It's dry and rich in tannins, with a soft, velvety mouthfeel. Shows interesting complications of smoked meats, pepper, cola and minerals. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A bit unripe, with herb and mint flavors side by side with blackberry and cassis. Shows classic Napa mountain structure of tannins and acids, but the mint reprises on the sharp finish. Not an ager. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Sourced entirely from Walla Walla's Les Collines Vineyard, this lovely Syrah features pretty strawberry and cherry flavors that are broadly displayed with a rich vein of chocolate. It's forward and flavorful, drinking quite nicely already, but with the stuffing to cellar for a few more years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine's judiciously restrained nose shows black fruits and dried herbs, with asphalt and focused rather than exuberant fig and plum aromas. There is lots of minty lift at the tip of the palate, which opens toward Mission figs, fudge and mocha. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Sengia Rossa is a blend of Corvina, Rondinella, Merlot and other varieties that shows plush, rich concentration and a soft, velvety feel. Aromas here include black cherry, cassis, leather, tobacco and a touch of licorice. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Undoubtedly one of the two star properties in Moulis. Its quality is impeccable: a Cabernet-dominated wine, with superrich black currant flavors that retain great structure and aging ability. Enjoy this wine in 5–10 years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A rich, soft, oaky Cabernet, forward and appealing in blackberry and cherry jam, cassis, mocha and olive flavors. Shows the class and distinction of the vineyard sources in Napa and Sonoma. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% each Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Complex old-vine characteristics emerge in a graceful, lengthy, detailed and subtle wine that weaves together herb, tobacco, olive and brambly berries. Drink now–2020. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Dolcetto, Refosco and Nebbiolo, this red is a lusty, tannic, acidic, slightly sweet wine. Nothing fancy going on, but for sheer power, it impresses. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Malpelo is a ramato-style Pinot Grigio (which means it sports a copperish color) with a cool glass closure that has done a good job of locking in the wine's fresh fragrances of citrus, rose, peach and white spice. Pair this wine with tuna steak or raw salmon tartar. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish. A new classic in every sense, with stellar balance and complexity. Less than 400 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Some years ago, Willamette Valley Vineyards purchased the Tualatin Estate vineyards and winery founded by Bill Fuller in 1973. To mark the return of Mr. Fuller to winemaking, the new cuvée celebrates his 40th vintage. A tawny gold, it's scented with honeycomb and pineapple. Potent and focused, it carries those flavors into a finish rich with bee pollen and preserved lemon intensity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a small-production blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc made by a winemaker who knows a lot about Bordeaux blends, Genevieve Janssens, the longtime vintner at Robert Mondavi. It's ripe and pretty tannic, with cassis and smoky, 100% new oak flavors. An ambitious wine, it's quite good, and needs time in the cellar to soften and resolve. Best after 2008, at least. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Intense aromas recall tropical fruit, crushed tomato vine and Granny Smith apples. The bright, juicy palate offers white peach, apricot, papaya, cantaloupe and almond, along with crisp acidity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Sourced from old-vine Wädenswil clones, this effort carries the new Elkton AVA designation. Pretty raspberry and strawberry fruit is set in lightly toasty tannins. This is a lovely everyday Pinot Noir with some density. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With off-dry flavors of ripe lemons, limes and vanilla, accented with brisk acidity, this simple wine will pair well with sweet Chinese and Vietnamese foods, and the price is right. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fresh, crisp and fruity, this is a good light rosé that could be a fine alternative to a red wine for a turkey or ham dinner. The finish is clean, round and flavored with red berry fruits. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Here's a bone-dry, crisply acidic and ultraclean Sauvignon Blanc. Its lemongrass, lime and grapefruit flavors are savory and bright, and accented with a cold streak of stony minerals. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine in a box is simple and direct, with pineapple, lime and peach flavors that are sugary sweet. But it's crisp and clean in acidity, and the box is the equivalent of four regular bottles. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This hearty Montepulciano d'Abruzzo from a relatively hot vintage (2005) offers loads of ripe, jammy fruit, plum and prune backed by exotic spice and black peppercorn. The wine shows solid, dark tannins on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Pretty good for the price. Dry and fruity, with polished cherry and cassis flavors. Turns a little harsh and minty, but easy to like with pizza, burgers, enchiladas. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts—the mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine adds to the growing case to be made for Cabernet Sauvignon in Livermore Valley. Mother Vine Reserve is a smallish offering for Concannon, loaded with black olive, tea and black pepper. It's Cab Franc-esque in some way, yet intensely dark, brooding and velvety. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Atypically dark in color, this brassy Châteauneuf blanc comes across as aromatically muted. Then it's very neutral in flavor, with ample breadth but lacking in richness and depth. It's something of a conundrum. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is a challenging Zin. It's fruity but it's also earthy and mushroomy, with a blast of vanilla oak. Right now it's pretty tannic, but beneath that roughness is a core of fruit. It's austere now—difficult even—but some time in the cellar could soften and open it. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rounder and more fruity than the inaugural 2007 Pinot Gris, this has succulent green apple and Bosch pear flavors balanced against crisp, refreshing acids. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Tannins and red plums combine in this light, elegant wine. The acidity is important though, with the fruit fresh rather than warm. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This appellation, on the west side of Salinas Valley just below Santa Lucia Highlands, is great for whites. Reds fare less well, especially when the vines are overcropped, as they seem to have been with this thin, acidic Merlot. It shows candied flavors of cherries and mint. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas suggest apricot, lemon drop, exotic fruit and subtle oak. The forward palate delivers yellow peach, nectarine, green melon and lemon drop alongside a note of vanilla. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This sparkling wine, a blend of 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, is dry, creamy and rich in flavors of citrus, yeast and vanilla. It feels refined and silky on the palate, with a honeyed finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Well structured, balanced, giving tannins as well as acidity to balance fruit that moves in the direction of sweet plums, with hints of coffee and vanilla spice. The wine has a texture that promises aging, but also has a delicious juicy character. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Another spectacular effort, though they've bumped up the price significantly. This is beautifully varietal, mixing floral, bath powder, apple and grapefruit components in both the nose and the mouth. There is an elegant intensity that powers the wine through an exceptionally long, brilliant finish; the residual sweetness keeps the alcohol down to 11.5% without making the wine either soft or sugary. 14,500 cases produced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A wine that is soft, rounded, ready to drink. It is without concentration or great acidity, but the white and light green fruits are delicious, giving an open character that is framed by toasty flavors and some spice. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Mild salinic aromas bring lime and lychee. Feels standard and smooth enough, with sweet white fruit flavors that suggest peach. As a semi-dry, it always feels and tastes sugary. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"2008 was a great vintage for Tax, and this Santa Barbara bottling is a great value. It really delivers, offering a dry, elegantly structured and complex wine. The silky texture houses savory flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and sandalwood, with an umami taste of bacon. Just delicious for drinking now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Apparently made from Bordeaux varieties, this wine is crisp and overtly sweet. It has simple, jammy flavors of pineapples, lemons and limes. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This easy Sangiovese should pair with a pizza or a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. There are mild fruit flavors here, followed by sun-drenched aromas of leather and spice. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Very good Dry Creek Zin, robust and dry and spicy. Really gets the tastebuds watering, with its tart flavors of sour cherry candy, red currants, blueberries, tart raisins and oodles of peppery spices. Drink this lusty wine with barbecue. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fans of the ripe, modern style of Chardonnay will fall in love with this bottling. It's strong in toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream and peach, pear and pineapple jam flavors that dazzle and wow the palate. Easy to find, with nearly 17,000 cases produced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Future vintages of this wine will bear the new Red Mountain appellation, for that is where Klipsun is located. Waterbrook does the grapes proud: This is a juicy, ripe white wine bursting with scents and flavors of fresh fruits, cut grass, light spice and even some toasted coconut in the extended finish. Best Buy. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a fresh and easy blend of Trebbiano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon (at an attractive low price) that offers clean, but not very intense, aromas of cut grass, field flowers and lemon. The wine renders a sweet, chewy sensation in the mouth with soft texture and a creamy finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of white flowers, stone fruits and lees are typical of well-made Albariño. A juicy, elegant palate with a mix of citrus and stone-fruit flavors is lasting, with a hint of pithy character coming up on the finish. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Polished and sophisticated, with lush green apple, pineapple, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors. Likeable for its balance and sheer drinkability. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A beautifully executed wine, this has fine aromas of cola, red currant, licorice, blue flower and moist earth. The texture is long, smooth, silky and elegant texture. There's a touch of menthol on the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This full and generous red wine from Umbria is aged 18 months in casks, 18 months in small barrel and 18 months in the bottle before its release. All this to soften the notoriously hard tannins of the Sagrantino grape. That firm structure is still very apparent and the wine ends with cherry, spice, and bold, super-ripe raspberry. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a silly name, and it's not a very good wine. Acids and tannins dominate, making it astringent and bitter, and the cherry fruit is thin and rather overripe. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fermented and aged in stainless steel without going through malolactic fermentation, this steely, waxy Albarino is ready for tapas, offering big bold tastes of peach and apricot. Textured and long-lasting, its tangible acidity will make seafood, especially shellfish, sing. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This luminous Pinot Grigio opens with simple aromas of stone fruit, melon and citrus and delivers fine levels of acidity and enough structure to carry forward with fish pasta or risotto. The wine performs nicely in the mouth thanks to its creamy texture. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot. Light cranberry and cherry fruit is set in a gently proportional bed of tart acid and pretty oak, 40% new. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This late-disgorged wine has been released at the age of 11 years. It's a beautiful wine, notable especially for the ultrafine feeling of the mousse, or bubbles. So refined and silky. Rich too are the flavors, in limes, strawberries, toasty lees and minerals. A spectacular sparkling wine that has many years of development ahead. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Quite a beautiful Cabernet, showing Oakville character of black currants and cedar and profoundly fine tannins, as well as a great depth of flavor and ageworthiness. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's lush and dramatic now, and should easily develop over the next 6–10 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Baking spice and toasted wood add warmth to preserved black cherry and plum flavors in this bold, lushly textured Cabernet Franc. The tannins are quite soft, but the dense fruit profile gives it weight and body. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"After an early blast of gaseous sulfur, this heavyweight Tempranillo smells of toasted oak, graphite, latex and alcohol. The palate is lush, meaty, jammy and borderline syrupy, while flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate finish with depth and extreme richness. Drink through 2025. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Here's a sweetly delicious young Pinot whose flavors are designed to please. It floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry jam, anise, cola, pepper and sandalwood notes, brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ever since Tamber Bey made the switch from Oakville fruit to their vineyard in Yountville, their Cabernets have dropped in quality. This '09 is dry, tannic and uninteresting, with a harshness that makes it difficult to appreciate the blackberry and cherry fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This opens with aromas of dark berry, toast, espresso and a whiff of dark cooking spice. The bracing palate offers unripe cherry, licorice, powdered sage and toasted oak alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent, mouth-puckering finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Made in the modern style, this Chardonnay is very ripe and rich in jammy pineapples, green apples and limes, enhanced with smoky, caramelized oak and a creamy, slightly sour note of lees. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Best now and through 2012 before the fruit goes south. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Just over 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Malbec (10%), Petit Verdot (8%) and Merlot, this wine offers brooding but well-delineated aromas and flavors of blackberry, dried flowers, black tea, herbs, earth, barrel spices and light meaty notes. It's packed tightly with firm tannins and also shows great length. Drink 2022–2028. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aging quickly, this tastes principally of raisins and brown sugar. The tannins are soft and the wine is at or slightly past its peak. Drink up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aged in large oak casks, this dark and thickly extracted Ripasso does a nice job of integrating mature black fruit aromas with spice and tobacco. The oak element is nicely tucked in the background and the wine shows bright fruit flavors in the mouth as well. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This tastes and feels a little gritty, with dry tannins. There's something old-fashioned about it, in an era of lush, sweet Cabernetss that appeal in their youth. A rich core of blackberry and black currant suggests that time in the cellar will be rewarded. Hold until 2017 or so. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Just about every Dyer Cabernet requires aging. The 2009 bottling is tough with tannins, despite intense blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. The winemaker held it back from release even longer than the 2010, but it's still juvenile, with unintegrated oak, fruit and mineral notes. The window of drinkability is 2015–2025. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Roughly equal parts Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, this is probably Lirac's top wine at the moment. It's big and rich in the mouth, leaving behind a coating of dark fruit, hints of meaty savoriness, baking spices and softly layered wood. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"An evenly dispersed nose of sage bark, cherry compote and lightly toasted cedar introduces this bottling by Fred Brander, a Santa Ynez Valley winemaking pioneer now actively trying to create a new Los Olivos District appellation. The flavors are balanced between cherry fruit and oak, with smooth tannins throughout. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A very good introduction to Steven Kent's Livermore Cabernets, sourced from a handful of his single-vineyard designates, including the Ghielmetti, Home Ranch and Smith Ranch. This is 79% Cab with smatterings of Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot (an up and coming varietal in Livermore), and still needs some time to develop but all the essentials are there. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Notes of pink roses and wild flowers open the bouquet of this delicate selection. It offers cranberry and citrus flavors over an easy, fresh finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a ripe, warm, full-bodied Crémant. It has a creamy, rich mousse, soft citrus and light acidity. The wine is forward, fruity and fresh, lightly tangy at the end. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Give this fresh young Pinot a year to mellow. Right now, it's jammy in raspberries and cherries, with a citric sharpness. Needs brief time to knit together and become seamless. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dull and watery. Not much going on beyond the alcohol, although you'll find very modest citrus flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ripeness is both this wine's blessing and its challenge. It's super-fruit in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants and cherries, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. But it's all on the surface, without much complexity. So drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"At the age of six-plus years, this Cab still is dominated by the 100% new French oak in which it was aged. The fruit flavor, too, is young and primary, offering sweetly ripe cherries and blackberries. Even the tannins are fresh. The suggestion is continued cellaring, and the statistics concerning alcohol, acidity and pH suggest ideal balance. Hold for at least a year and try again. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Though not planted until 2001, the east-facing Lone Oak Vineyard is adjacent to the legendary vines of Garys' and Rosella's. The nose conveys lemon-lime soda and white rock minerality, and flavors combine baked apple, yeasty bread and lime. Bright acidity exhilarates the tongue, making a perfect partner for a lunch of shellfish, halibut or chicken salad. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Taurasi is a wine that flaunts a determined and powerful personality, and Fatica Contadina is no exception, thanks to its deep layers of spice, dark fruit, tobacco and cigar that it delivers to the senses. On the palate, it is austere and tightly structured. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Fruity, crisp with red-currant and citrus flavors, this is a bright, vivacious wine. There is a tight mineral edge that contrasts with the fruitiness and turns this into a food friendly wine. Drink now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Made from DuBrul Vineyard fruit, this has lush strawberry and raspberry flavors that dig deep into the core, supported by a base of minerality. The tightly-focused finish includes echoes of toasty barrel-derived flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There are brambly notes here of forest floor and underbrush backed by enough fresh fruit to keep the wine chewy and fresh in the mouth. You'll also get notes of wet tobacco and wild mushroom that add complexity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Basic Chard, if thin, with just enough peaches and cream, vanilla and toast flavors to satisfy. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a difficult wine to understand, with a very specific philosophy behind it. Light, elegant and ethereal, the 60-40 blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato is aged in terracotta amphorae in a studied attempt to present as pure a product as nature allows. It offers loads of bright fruit, wild berries, earth, spice and impressive complexity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Nice and oaky and rich, from a vineyard in the heart of the cool-climate southern part of Russian River Valley. Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This attractively priced wine has nice acidity and subtle flavors of pear and lemon. A pronounced swaddling in oak reveals itself on the nose and mid-palate. Enjoy it with food on the richer side. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fruity, rich and honey-sweet, with decadent flavors of peach and pear jam, apricot, pineapple, green apple and vanilla, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. There's a good spine of acidity for balance. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This plush, rich expression of Pinot Grigio from northeast Italy would pair with white meat, seafood risotto or spicy dishes from the Far East. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and long-lasting. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The winery identifies this as “the best barrels from our best lots.” Supple and streaked with chocolate and caramel, this explosion of cherry, cassis, cola and Dr. Pepper contains sneaky notes of tobacco and pepper threaded through the lingering finish. Richness and depth prevail throughout. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Spicy and exuberant, if not particularly subtle, a big, juicy wine to drink with steaks and roasts. Bone dry, and pretty tough in tannins, it has flavors of blackberries, leather, cola, coffee and pepper. Ready now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With cassis and plum aromas, this mid-weight Cabernet Sauvignon from the Foothills has a taste of licorice and vanilla, particularly on the finish, testament to its 33 months in new American oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smells and tastes porty, but dry, with raisiny-chocolaty flavors of blackberries and currants. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very few wineries got Walla Walla grapes in this freeze year, and even L'Ecole, which owns a piece of the Seven Hills vineyard, had to rely on other sources for many of its wines. But this is 100% Seven Hills Syrah, and it delivers wonderful fruit flavors with layers of citrus and tart berries. A green tea streak cuts through the substantial tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Clos de la Chapelle surrounds an old chapel in the Morgeot Premier Cru. This 2010 is full, ripe and intense, with yellow fruit and toast flavors that combine with tight acidity to create richness and structure. Complex, concentrated and age worthy. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Sourced from a vineyard planted by Gary Andrus in 1998, this elegant and expressive wine is shaded a lovely rose tone, and scents of rose petals and ripe cherries emerge instantly from the glass. It's well defined, balanced and detailed with sandalwood, cocoa powder, cinnamon and orange-liqueur highlights. Drink now through 2021. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine features tempting clove, black cherry and pomegranate flavors. It has great balance, an easygoing texture and a clean, fruity finish. It's medium to full bodied, but the oaky flavors and tannins stay well within bounds. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fresh, full bodied and juicy, this has flavors of dusty, dark plum and chocolate. It was aged in both French and American oak, which has added a background note of tobacco and vanilla on the palate, particularly on the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Sobra is Brazilian Portuguese for leftovers. It's a Bordeaux blend, but the recipe changes every year. This is very nice and drinking well, smooth with a nicely resolved mix of black fruits, smoky wood, pepper and a bit of bacon fat. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The excellent aromas show the muscle and meat typical of the better Syrahs, and the concentrated palate is a well-crafted blend of brambly berry, pepper, sea salt, cured meat and loam. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Great price for a brut this classically structured. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's dry and crisp, with a fine mousse that gives it a creamy smooth mouthfeel. The pineapple, raspberry and vanilla flavors are delicious. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made in the rich, ripe, over-the-top style that winemaker Mark McNeilly uses for his own Mark Ryan Viogniers, this is a superconcentrated wine with more than a passing resemblance to limoncello. Along with that comes notes of Key lime, candied pineapple and a bit of alcoholic heat. Some will find it excellent, others a little too extravagant. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Powerful and intense without going over the top, this is a fine example of white Hermitage. The golden straw color gives a first indication of its richness, followed by scents of honey, even a hint of butterscotch. It's unctuous in the mouth, boasting flavors of grilled nuts and stone fruits, and finishing with just a touch of warmth. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Though varietally labeled, this intriguing white Rhône includes 12% each Marsanne and Grenache Blanc. Rich and satisfying, it brings the buttery density of a ripe Chardonnay, but mixes the fruits for more drama—cantaloupe, apricot, banana, and a bit of papaya. A total yum-fest. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"If you know the Rhône-style wines of Saxum, which is probably Paso Robles' most expensive wine, this is nearly identical. Mostly Syrah, with 8% Grenache, the wine is decadently rich in milk chocolate, blackberry jam and sweet, smoky oak flavors. It's very high in alcohol, but unless you're an extremist in this regard, you can't help but be knocked out by the wine's sensuous pleasures. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A pretty good Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, with crisp acidity and a backbone of tannins. The flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit are delicious, but the texture is scoury and a little warm, even though the alcohol is relatively low. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Flavors of creamy vanilla pudding, buttered toast and pineapple jam mark this slightly sweet Chardonnay. A crisp streak of acidity provides much needed balance to the richness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Amazingly delicious and soft. Defines the modern Napa Cabernet style, with the tasteful elegance Hall wines are known for. With 20% Merlot, it displays dazzlingly rich flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red currants and mocha, with a savory note of bacon. Now–2013. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A distinctive Syrah that shows great concentration in the focused blackberry, sweet leather, dark chocolate, mineral and black pepper flavors. Beyond the power, the wine is bone dry, soft in acidity and quite tannic. The end result is impressive, and ready to drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Spice and blackcurrant aromas are combined with solid tannins and powerful wood flavors to give a spectacular, polished style, a contrast to the  often rustic wines that come from this appellation. The wine comes from 90-year old vines that are then aged in 70% new wood for 18 months. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Light, fresh wine, showing pineapple and pear flavors, but in a delicate way. It has lift, crispness, a fine touch of citrus and a hint of toast. An attractive, easy white Burgundy. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Cola-like in flavor, with earthier notes of tobacco and leather. Drinks pretty lean, and the tannins are strong. Finshes with a bitterness of acids and tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This is a classic style of Cabernet that should improve with age. It smells like pencil shavings, tobacco and cedar, and tastes like dark chocolate and black cherry, while feeling very firm on the palate. It has fine-grained tannins, and a lingering dark chocolate and cherry finish. It will be best after 2018. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The '07 release of this wine, a blend of four considerable vineyards, was great. This 2008 is less so, although it's still a fine wine. Packed with cherry, cola and spice flavors, it's a little raw in the mouth. Decant for a few hours before drinking. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The weight of the structure is almost overpowering for the fresh blackberry fruits in the wine. Its presence is big, powerful, with bitter fruits and black figs, finishing with a final punch of richness. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Like almost all of Reverie's Cabernets on release, this one needs time in the cellar. Tasted in fall 2011, it's tight and grapey, with blackberry jam flavors girded by a firm, stony minerality and sweet, but hard, tannins. Give it 6–8 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Vibrant and lively red fruit aromas blend with fragrant woody spice in the bouquet. The cherry and berry flavors transition to the palate, where somewhat gripping tannins coupled with notes of fudgy brownie and black pepper add depth to the finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Blue-flower and red-berry aromas lead the way along with a whiff of eucalyptus. The firm palate offers hints of star anise, espresso and a green note of powdered sage that back up unripe red cherry. It closes on a coffee note. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"An extraordinarily rich Pinot, fat and opulent in cherry compote, mocha and root beer flavors. Generously oaked, it offers spicy oak notes and a velvety texture. It's a big, fruit-forward wine, but manages to maintain delicacy and harmony throughout. Best now through 2008. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Light red fruits, perhaps just a little stewed and herbal, with a soft mouthfeel and mocha-streaked finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Simple and seemingly sweet, this Chardonnay has apricot jam flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A bit rough in texture, but otherwise pretty flavorful, with vanilla, lime, strawberry and yeast flavors. It's a great sparkling wine for everyday. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Pretty good Cab for the price, a little soft, but ripe enough, with upfront blackberry and cherry flavors and that chocolate fudge note that marks so many modern Cabs. It's a pleasantly dry wine with some real complexity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With its tobacco and fresh raspberry aromas, this is a light, perfumed, smoky wine of fragrant Cabernet Franc with a touch of blueberry tannins and an intense burst of finishing acidity. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This hearty red wine from central Italy would pair well with grilled meat or veal wrapped in sage leaves and sliced prosciutto ham. Loads of red berries are followed by notes of exotic spice, leather, tobacco and firm tannins. Drink in 3–5 more years. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Another good job at a relatively inexpensive white variety from Clos du Bois. With Lake and Sonoma county grapes, the wine shows good Sauvignon Blanc character. Dry and crisp, it's savory in lemongrass, grapefruit and peach flavors that are lightly oaked. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Pure Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon fruit brings sexy flavors of wild berry and cassis. This vintage has bright acids and fairly tamed tannins, and the fruit pops out with lovely cherry flavors. Maybe not as concentrated as some past vintages, but beautifully proportioned, accessible and still ageworthy over the medium term. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A bit rugged and hot in the mouth. Offers a good array of plummy cherry flavor, with bright, zingy acidity and a touch of smoky oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer. The oaky flavors quickly overtake fruit that is simple, clean, and apple flavored. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Hats off to the Zonin family for being among the first to offer a Viognier from southern Tuscany. This shows the thick viscosity that is characteristic of the variety, with floral notes of violets and lemon blossoms. There's a dusty touch of mineral or brimstone on the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of chocolate mint, creamy vanilla and candy reflect a heavy-handed oak treatment, and a sweet burnt cherry and chocolate mint character is present throughout. Creamy on the tongue, but confected in terms of flavors and finish. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Dark berry, truffle, toast and kitchen spice aromas meld in the glass. On the palate, notes of roasted coffee bean, powdered sage and ground pepper accent a core of dried black cherry while assertive tannins provide the framework. It ends on an astringent note. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This delivers a very lively and plush quality of ripe blackberry, leather, tobacco, cola and cigar box. The mouthfeel is bold, soft and velvety. Keep this wine in your cellar for five years or more. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine has some good blackberry and oak flavors. But the strong, green hit of vegetable is distracting. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This offers black currant flavors and firm, stalky tannins. It has acidity, a good juicy character and a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2015. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A little sharp and minty, this Pinot is very dry, with acidic flavors of cherries and cola. The mouthfeel is silky. It's not going anywhere, so drink up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of blue flower, black-skinned fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub meld in the glass. The chewy, straightforward palate doles out juicy black cherry and ground pepper. It's made to drink young so enjoy soon. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This extremely limited (47 cases) Syrah is dedicated to the owners' daughter Jaden, who is pictured on the label. Very classy Wahluke Slope fruit sends up citrus, spice, pineapple and lime aromas over bright, sappy raspberry and cherry fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Parducci's '03 True Grit was a sensation. The '04 is a worthy successor. Dry, tannic and amazingly rich, it floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, currant, leather, coffee, carob and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. Like any great young Petite Sirah, it will age for many years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Old vines have produced a superconcentrated and ripe wine. It has notes of toast, spice and yellow fruit as well as bright acidity. With its structure, depth of flavor and density, it should age well over 3–4 years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Young and fresh, it has excellent minerality. The fruit is light and lively, leaning toward grapefruit, green apple and a smidge of just-ripe melon. It's a lovely summer sipper, with a few good years of life ahead. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A lovely wine, soft and charming, but far from simple. Although it has complex layers of cherries, blackberries, cassis and cedar, it also shows a fine structure of ripe, smooth tannins and supporting acidity. Drink now–2015 while it's fresh and forward. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This cheerful Rosso di Montalcino offers a distinctively oak-driven bouquet of smoke, spice and mesquite followed by a bright ensemble of berry fruit aromas. The wine is soft and slightly sweet on the finish with a burst of cherry and blueberry at the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Prieto Picudo is a variety unknown to most wine drinkers. And that's probably a good thing, because the grape yields acidic, tight, astringent wines like this. Yes, there's color and size here, but there's not much balance or charm. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Relatively tight and closed up at this stage, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in 5 years time—it will be magnificent. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Lots of ripe, jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate fruit in this easy-drinking Cab. Shows some rusticity, though, in the raisiny finish and astringency of the tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Morellino di Scansano is known in Italy as an informal, fruit-forward wine that washes down beautifully with heaping plates of pasta and home cooked meals. This expression follows squarely in that tradition and offers perky aromas of cherry cola, spice, blackberry and dried Mediterranean herbs. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"On the sharp and lean side, showing sour red cherry candy, wintergreen and green peppercorn flavors, fattened with sweet oak. Dry and elegant, but not very rich. Drink up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This has bell pepper and red currant aromas along with obvious oak and vanilla sensations, all of which carry over to the palate alongside a forward espresso note. A bit shy on vibrancy, it's also tightly tannic and demonstrates the heat of the vintage. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A solid wine, with plum skin and dry tannin textures. It does have the ripe fruit of 2009, attractive red fruits and juicy acidity. But it needs aging over at least three years to show its fruitiness. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"I have seldom tasted a Dry Creek Valley Cabernet (the appellation, not the winery) that didn't have a woolly edge to it. This wine is an excellent example. It's briary, with pushy tannins and the succulent flavor of wild blackberries. Oak adds a sheen of vanilla and smoke. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smells and tastes ungenerous, probably due to unripe grapes that give an earthy, vegetal taste to the wine. Not going anywhere, so drink up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dusty and detailed, this pure Viognier incorporates notes of lemon-pepper; tart, fresh lemon pulp and rind; plus a hint of curry powder. This should make an interesting accompaniment to raw clams or oysters. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ero is packed tight with bright berry, cassis and white almond. That all-Sicilian jamminess you sometimes find in this variety is absent here. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a light, fresh and fruity wine, with an attractive red-berry flavor, plus acidity and a soft structure. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"An easy to like Syrah, soft and gentle, with raspberry, cherry, spice, tobacco, herb and smoke flavors. Defines the warm-climate, lighter style of Paso Robles Syrah. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"For fans of semisweet bubbly in a bright salmon shade, this sparkler offers a confected nose reminiscent of watermelon Jolly Ranchers. Softly pétillant with a heavy, syrupy texture, the palate is akin to liquid cotton candy. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is way too soft and unstructured, especially at this price. It's a sweet, syrupy wine, with blackberry jam and cocoa flavors, and it's also high in alcohol. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A certain creamy nuttiness is suggested on the nose. The sunniness of 2015 is expressed by a generous mirabelle ripeness. The body still is very slight and subtle and all about a graceful texture. There's a lovely touch of lemon freshness on the finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is an attractive, ready-to-drink wine. Its juicy red fruits are balanced with tannins, offering a dry contrast. The finish is dark, structured and suggestive of the wine's potential for aging. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"With a modern winery located at the foot of the picturesque town of Barolo, Cascina Adelaide proudly produces a bold and innovative interpretation of Barolo. This is a powerful and generous wine with big spice, berry, smoke and mineral tones. The cards it plays best, however, are intensity and persistency. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Banfi presents an easy, no-fuss Chianti Classico that showcases Sangiovese typicity and personality. This is a profoundly food-friendly wine with built-in natural acidity that pairs it with butter or cream-based pasta dishes. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"From Dijon clones, this sculpted, tight, compact Chardonnay feels as if it is shut in a cocoon. Give it time (and decanting) to unwrap, and it shows elegant tropical and stone fruits, caramel, vanilla cream and butter flavors, backed with moderate acids. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"For any serious fan of Rivesaltes, this is a must-have example. Aromas of dried apricot, toasted hazelnut, fig, ginger, sweet spice and candied orange rind fill the bouquet, while the mouth is silky and balanced—sweet and heady without being cloying. All of the aromas transition onto the palate alongside accents of walnut skins and shiitake mushroom. Soft salinity makes the long finish even more mouthwatering. Drink now, or continue to age. There are 869 bottles produced. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Dry and succulent, this brings tangy flavors of rhubarb and raspberry into focus. It's made for picnic foods—could anything be better with fried chicken? This is widely available and scores a bullseye if your target is a summer sipper. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A food-friendly blend of Sangiovese, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc that shows easy but rich and intense fruit flavors of cherry and blackberry, plus a subtle spice note. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Notable for its firm minerality and acidity and distinguished mouthfeel. Could be a little richer, but offers intricate raspberry, sour cherry candy, blueberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Might blossom over the next few years. Drink now–2013. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This gorgeous wine exhibits beautiful sophistication and austere aromas of elegant spice, candied fruit, licorice and maple syrup. It has aged beautifully thus far and promises a bright future ahead. The mouthfeel is tight and polished with firm tannins and exceptional integrity of fruit. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The nose is volatile and pruney, the color dark, almost Port-like. The wine is very soft and flat. The fruit seems waxy and dead, lightly pruney but also a bit green; it tastes as though half the grapes were underripe and half were raisined. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of Alicante and Petit Verdot that render a soapy, herbal nose with accents of root beer, exotic spice, lavender potpourri and green pepper corn. It is very well balanced. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Soft and dense with dark fruit, almost baked fruit flavors, that veer into nuts and vanilla, an easy-drinking Zin blended with a smidge of Zin from the 2009 and 2010 vintages as well as 7% Petite Sirah crafted by a Lodi producer to watch. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Butterscotch and pineapple and peach jam flavors mark this Chardonnay. Fortunately, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a certain minerality. It's an obvious crowd pleaser, and would score higher except for the seemingly sweet finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"La Giaretta is an up-and-coming winery in full evolution with a modern approach and excellent pricing. There are deep oak aromas here that thankfully do not overwhelm delicate notes of cherry cola, cough drop, Indian spice, herbal infusion and almond. This is a spice-driven wine with a velvety texture and lively fruit on the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Classic Lodi Cab, from a vintage that wasn't too hot or too cool. The wine is soft and lush, with milk chocolate and cassis flavors and the vanillins and sweet char of oak. Easy and delicious, it's a wine to drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"May be getting old but still welcoming and mostly fresh. Citrus, melon and mango flavors are flush and clean, and the finish is racy and fluid. Normally Albariño is a one-year wine, meaning you should drink it in the year immediately after harvest. Here's an '05 that's hanging in there and still showing kick. Drink now for best results. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming. Interestingly, the wine is a bit more tart and refined on the palate, where zesty but full apple and pear flavors run the show. Not lean but definitely streamlined and acidic. More of a food wine than a stand-alone sipper. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Here's an elegant expression of Cabernet Sauvignon with smooth aromas of wild berries and cherry that are seamlessly integrated with light shadings of spice and toast. The wine is crisp and generous on the palate and delivers a smooth, but determined texture. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Fresh strawberry aromas set the scene for a bright, red berry flavored wine. It has vibrant, vivid acidity and exotic perfumes. The tannins, however, do suggest that this is a bigger, tougher wine than the fruit offers. Over the next few months, it is likely to fill out and become more dense. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Made from Tempranillo, this is a really pleasant rosé that shows a balance rare in California. Totally dry, crisp and relatively low in alcohol, the wine manages to be long and deep in creamy, spicy cherry, raspberry and vanilla bean flavors. Great job. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made with organically farmed fruit, this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Colorino opens with an inky, dark color and savory aromas of ripe fruit, prune, plum, leather, tobacco and exotic spice. It's firm and well structured, with a velvety feel to the tannins. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Considering the reputation of Lynch-Bages as a rich, polished wine, it is not surprising that, in 2003, the team of Jean-Michel Cazes and Daniel Lhose produced a superlatively ripe, opulent wine, one that could almost have come from Napa. But not quite: The fruit is compact and dense, with layers of acidity that speak more of  Bordeaux than California. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"From young vintner Giovanni Abrigo in the Treiso area, this is a lovely expression of Barbaresco with immediate aromas of cherry, cassis, spice, smoke, leather and tobacco. The wine is approachable now, but it's also built to last: natural concentration, bright fruit flavors and acidity will hold ten years or more. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine wears its 15.8% alcohol better than any similarly heady wine out there. Yes, it's a bit hot, but the heat comes across as a slight chili pepper edge to the blackberry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors, and the wine is, in its own way, balanced and elegant. Hard to imagine a more perfect barbecue red. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The classic blend for Figeac with its 32% of Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc gives a beautifully dense wine with great tannins. The wine is perfumed while the complex tannins are finely cushioned by the generous black fruits and acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2026. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is a lovely Zinfandel, soft and appealing. It has fine balance and is dry and rich in cherry, currant, Provençal herb, spice and tobacco flavors. Shows real complexity as it changes in the glass. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Consistent with the rather lean house style this opens with herbal aromas set against firm, varietal cassis and blue plum fruit. The grapes come from a block planted in 1985. Some barrel spice adds cinnamon to the nose, and there's a touch of Cab Franc (6%) in the blend, which stiffens up the tannins. Retasting this wine after it has spent a few extra months in bottle, it's smoothed out a bit, and the sweet black- cherry fruit has moved forward. This should age really well. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A bit on the soft, overripe side, with currant, licorice, cherry, cocoa and oak flavors. But it's dry, and the tannins are fancy. Drink it fresh out of the bottle with a grilled steak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This vineyard designate from Yountville is packed with compact tannin and rich oak yet nicely balanced by crisp ranberry, cherry and clove flavors. Light black-pepper notes add seasoning. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Plum and black cherry fruit flavors are at the core of this warmly generous wine, a round mouthful of fruit and sweet baking spices. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A pure strawberry jam wine, its ripe fruit scintillating with freshness and acidity. The wine is also round, with tannins giving some weight. The aftertaste is deliciously fruity. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"The aromas that greet you from the glass bring flowers, cherries, hints of cured meat and more. The wine is already drinking nicely, with an elegant mix of pie cherries and fruit pastry flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is gorgeous with a delicate but intense bouquet of pressed rose, wet earth, licorice cola and dried berry fruit. The mouthfeel is incredibly long and silky. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Pretty notes of Italian espresso, chocolate and spice revolve around a core of solid black fruit. This is an elegant and refined wine that boats a traditional style that is never overdone or too powerful. In fact, it showcases its delicate berry nuances very nicely in the mouth. Drink after 2014. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a bright and fruit-forward red wine from Piedmont in Northern Italy that exhibits prominent, but not overly intense or intrusive, aromas of fresh fruit, exotic spice and drying mineral. The wine has a fresh acidic component balanced by a jammy, sweet finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Crisp white-fruit aromas come with a touch of green grass. It feels regular, with briny lime and tart apple flavors. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Unique and appealing, with scents of pear drop and roasted walnuts leading into a luxuriously textured palate. Caramel notes from toasty new oak vie with kiwi flavors in the mouth while the finish is long and dry. Drink now or age a few years for even more complexity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"There is definitely some good ripeness here but cherry and farmyard tones are hampered by a bit too much sulfur while the short finish shows some nice leather but also a funky undertone. Not the best of its class. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A light style, but still stylish, with finesse and good structure. The pretty plum fruit is lightly dusted with cocoa, softening the tannins and adding spice to the finish. A gentle and beguiling wine, ready for near-term enjoyment. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This elegant effort is 46% Cab Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 18% Cab Franc; still wrapped up tight and showing tart cassis and berry fruit. There is a lot of the classic Ciel minerality underlying the fruit, with hard tannins and lightly peppery herbal details. At just 14.1% alcohol, this is a classic example of how Washington brings bright New World fruit and terroir to a style that retains the elegance of the Old World. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A little sugar goes a long way. This dessert wine is primarily Ain, with a splash of Muscat and Viognier. It's quite sweet, with apricot, tangerine, peach, honey and dusty spice flavors. This would be a great wine if the flavors were more concentrated. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made from estate-vineyard fruit, this Merlot is medium bodied, and it has a mix of red fruit flavors, plus grace notes of leaf and mushroom. The finish leaves an impression of dried toast. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is an attractively herbal rendering of Côtes du Rhône Villages, offering hints of flowering thyme, sage and rosemary that are rounded out by flavors of just-ripe cherries. It's a medium-bodied wine, with a long on the finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Big, rich and fruity, with fantastically ripe cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors that are elevated by a note of sweet sandalwood, and brightened with crisp acidity. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the long, spicy finish. This is too young to drink now; it needs 5–6 years to mellow. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Peachy Canyon's least expensive wine is a soft, simple, and rather sweet with candied raspberry and cherry flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ripe, pure flavors of tropical fruits, Meyer lemons, limes and peaches mark this lovely Chardonnay. New French oak adds luscious notes of buttered toast. With crisp acidity and a clean, spicy finish, it's a beautiful Chard to drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A smooth wine, the tannins suspended within a velvet texture, resulting in an opulent, rich feel. This is very intense, with medicinal and dark plum skin flavors. Powerful, solid, for aging. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Relatively low in alcohol (12.2% is the listing), this is thin on fruit but does offer soft flavors of yeasty bread dough, along with some stemmy tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Simple and direct, with minty flavors of blackberries, licorice, cola, peppercorns and vanilla. On the plus side, the wine is fully dry, the tannins smooth. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This riserva opens with a textured, granular mouthfeel that is packed tight with leather, tobacco, dried berry and cola flavors. The close is fresh and menthol-driven. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This epitomizes Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel. It's dry, briary and brambly, with wild berry, cola and crisped bacon flavors. It's incredibly spicy, offering everything from black and white pepper to nutmeg, anise and clove. The texture is a delight—silky and gently tannic. While the official alcohol is 13.7%, it tastes warmer. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah has a lot of heat and power locked within, recognized by slightly cooked or jammy fruit notes. But you'll also get very pleasant, warm tones of soft leather and sweet pipe tobacco. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The 2009 vintage blend is 41% Marsanne, 42% Grenache Blanc, 10% Picpoul and 7% Roussanne. Complex, rich and dense, it wraps its stone and tropical fruit flavors in layers of caramel, nougat, marshmallow and spice. Still quite young, with plenty of years of life ahead. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"A bit heavy for a rosé, without quite the liveliness you want. It's a very fruity wine, with forward raspberry, vanilla, cocoa and spice flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Strong , complex aromas, with notes of tropical fruit and coconut. In the mouth, it's oaky and spicy, with penetrating, bright, effusive flavors that you might go so far as to call racy. The alcohol content is high and it drinks a little soft, but this is a very seductive wine. A crowd-pleaser, for sure. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From the Côte de Rouffach area, this is a wine that's eminently alive. Apricot, nectarine and mango comprise the all-fruit nose and palate. All in all, it's like a peachy parfait. If you dig deep you'll find some of those custard, stone and petrol nuances that give Alsace Rieslings their character. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Fresh ripe raspberry aromas are cut with cranberry-skin tartness in this wine by Josh Baker and Matt Brain. They have also managed to sneak blood, pencil shavings, eucalyptus and vanilla stick into the nose of this appellation blend. It's lively and tasty with ripe, tart red fruits once sipped, juicy yet cut with chaparral scrub elements. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This latest edition of Hekate opens with a bright amber-gold color and shows lively aromas of stone fruit, especially apricot, honey, caramel, almond paste and yellow rose. It tastes thick, sticky and deliciously sweet on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A mix of fruit that survived the big freeze, from Dwelley, Morrison Lane and Minnick vineyards. It's tight, tart and tannic, and showing some pickle barrel notes from time in new American oak. Herbal and compact, this is a wine that should probably be given another year or so in the bottle to smooth itself out. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rustic and thin-flavored, with odd citrus and medicinal flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise. Shows modest peach and pear flavors, with lots of caramelly, toasty oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With its deep, tart-sweet black-plum aromas and flavors wrapped in a toasty oak blanket, this is an appealing, modern-style Barbera. The grape's native acidity is well tamed, but enough remains to make it a great food match. Has good tannic structure, yet has immediate appeal. Finishes long, dark and handsome. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A good Zinfandel, dry and rich in the thick tannins you'd expect off Howell Mountain. The blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are liberally spiced with pepper. Loses a few points for a certain green herbaceousness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is mucky and sweet. Its best foot is not put forward via the compost-like nose, and from then on there's little more than prune, leather and a sticky mouthfeel. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Kind of like Pinot Grigio, in that it's a delicate, unoaked (although leesy) wine with citrusy, figgy flavors and bright, citrusy acidity leading to a slightly sweet finish. It's food-versatile and user-friendly. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From the Lonesome Spring Ranch vineyard, this is very fresh, with juicy citrus and orange peel flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fresh berries, young spice and raw notes of blueberry and raspberry color this bright blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese from Central Italy. The wine is sharp and immediate in terms of the delivery of its easy tannins and bright, acidic finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"High in acidity and ripe in pineapple and vanilla flavors, this is a simple wine. It has sweet and sour flavors, like a sour cough drop. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made by Carabella, this popular budget Pinot sports solid, country flavors. Plenty of bright, vivid and tart fruit—berries and cherries—give it a full-bodied, forward expression. But it's not all front-loaded; there is surprising depth, and overall a fine balance. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ripe and generously oaked on the palate, this Chardonnay has flavors of pineapple jam, buttered toast and buttered popcorn. It's brightened with crisp acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Musella is a producer of very good reputation in the non-Classico zone, with some of Valpolicella's most beautiful vineyards. This plump ripasso offers density, with loads of sweet berry flavors to boot. Pair it with polenta and gorgonzola cheese. Imported by Vintners Estate Direct Importing. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Crisp and fruity, this is a classic rosé. It shows a lightness that comes from the delicately handled fruits, giving gentle berry flavors, bright acidity and a textured aftertaste. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, showing sweet raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Brilliant acidity and wonderfully soft tannins make this Pinot instantly drinkable, yet it should age over the next 6–8 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a Prosecco from the Cartizze cru (offered by the excellent Bortolin estate) that boasts mineral notes and talc powder followed by plush, creamy peach and yellow fruit. The wine ends with a very feminine note of fresh flowers. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Packaged in an unusual plastic-style recyclable bag, with a seal you have to figure out how to open, this is a fine Sauvignon Blanc. At the equivalent of 10 bucks for a regular bottle, it's dry, crisp and fruity, with lime and gooseberry flavors. Delivers lots of bang for the buck. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With too much oak and too sweet fruit, the result is an unbalanced Chardonnay. It tastes like LifeSaver lemon candies cooked into a baked Alaska dessert. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"No, that's not a typo. The ??? Vineyard bottling conceals (intentionally) the fruit sources for these grapes, which come from one of Oregon's most expensive and highly-reviewed producers. It's crystal-clear in both appearance and flavor, building upon a cranberry\/raspberry base into a potent young wine with expressive purity. A streak of gun metal, often found in consulting winemaker Robert Brittan's own wines, adds a stylish note to the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This pure Cabernet Sauvignon is not a heavy wine, but within its sleek profile are interesting flavors of berry, leaf and earth. Tannins are crisp and proportionate, and the fruit carries through a graceful, moderately long finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Full-bodied and juicy. Offers a wealth of blackberry, black cherry, plum, tobacco, bacon and pepper spice flavors that are housed in thick tannins. Production was 4,877 cases, so should be easy to find. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Lush concentration and deep aromas of dark fruit and black cherry make an excellent first impression. This Dolcetto shows a dark, deep color and a chewy, almost inky texture. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This pleasing blend yields a spicy, fruity wine with sweet strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Though two thirds new oak was used, it is not prominent. Smooth and accessible, this delicious wine is accented with aromas of sweet straw. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"I've found variability in Especial, despite its high price. It shows an artisinal, vintage-driven nature that can be beguiling or rough. The '04 is a bit of both. It's not a smooth, seductive Zin. The tannins are too feral. But it is interesting, with complex blackberry, blueberry, cherry and Asian spice flavors. Try aging, but not too long. You don't want to lose that fresh fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Packaged in a modern screwcap bottle, this friendly blend of Ribolla Gialla with smaller percentages of Friulano and Riesling delivers a bright golden color and lively fruit aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is crisp and lively in the mouth and perfectly captures the spirit of winemaking in Northeast Italy. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Erath's fresh and lightly fruity Pinot Gris is a bit more substantial than this new Pinot Blanc. Soft and fruity, this is a simple wine which does not challenge the palate in any way. All stainless steel fermented, it is the quintessential quaffer. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Tastes as heavy and sugary sweet as cherry pie filling without the crust, lacking structural integrity and dryness. Does not help the reputation of the vineyard. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An very pretty aromatic package with melon, pineapple, apple and pear. Good, and not hugely complex, but definitely casual and approachable. Imported by Halby Marketing. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Given the diverse clonal make-up of the vines that go in to this Pinot, the aromas are somewhat muted and shy. Earthy, spicy fruit flavors are characterized by baked red raspberry and strawberry notes, with the wine taking on a denseness on the palate and finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Something like a cross between a silky Pinot Noir and a soft Merlot, this is a gentle, fruity wine, with berry, tobacco, cola and spice flavors. A nice scour of tannins suggests this will pair with rich, oily meats and cheeses. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Impresses for the sheer volume of the fruit. Flamboyant tropical pineapple, mango, guava, lots of dusty spices, rich oak, but manages to hold onto balance, dryness and even a sense of finesse all the way through the long finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A Côtes du Rhône-style blend meant to be drunk early and around a weekday meal, among Terre Rouge's easiest to drink and find wines. There's lots to like, from the wine's high-toned cherry and boysenberry aromas and flavors to its traces of black olive and jaunty, gamy pepper. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A very fruity, extracted Zin, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors that finish with a bite of acidity. Clean and easy to drink, it's a nice sipper with summer barbecue. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is bone dry, with lots of zesty acidity and flavors of sour cherry candy, pomegranate and persimmon, with a mushroomy earthiness. It should change over the next four years, although not necessarily improving. Try pairing it with steak, lamb or a rich cut of ahi tuna. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This captivating wine treads the line between Rhône and Bordeaux. A splash of Cabernet, though just a fraction of the blend, stands out. The wine has depth and persistence, and the mix of grapes works well, showing brambly red fruits, like a Zin, spice and pepper, like Syrah, and some herbal and leafy tobacco in the finish. Complex, unique and quite appealing. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A quite green style of Champagne, very clean and very crisp. From one of the Champagne cooperatives, this is a great value wine, with pleasing freshness. Imported by Grape Expectations of Georgia. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Soft and simple, with candied peach and pear flavors and some oaky, leesy influence that makes it a little fancier. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A ripe and spicy blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this has ripe black fruits that are laced with firm, dry tannins. There is a herbal character that gives it an edge. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A beautifully drinkable Merlot. It's softly tannic and quite dry, with a polish of smoky oak that frames deep, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and exotic spices. Very nice now and for the next 3–4 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There's something old-fashioned about this wine, in its strong, edgy tannins and rustic mouthfeel. Yet it's high and hot in alcohol, with extracted, jammy cherry and raisin flavors. Doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is blended from two finished wines: a 2005 Counoise (64%) and a 2006 Viognier (36%). It's ripe and round and showing strawberry and peach flavors. The two grapes work together well, and create a seamless wine with plenty of fruit power. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Crushed stone and dried clay notes lend a distinctly earthen character to this dry light-bodied Riesling. Pressed apple and pear flavors on the palate are freshened by squirts of lime, lemon and a tart green-plum finish. The finish is long and lingering. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A delicious and interesting white wine, made from a variety more usually used for blending purposes. It's honey-rich but dry, similar in structure to an oaky Chardonnay, with tropical fruit and vanilla flavors that have a pleasant touch of bitterness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Woody, brambly notes lend an earthy complexity to fresh blackberry and cassis notes on this bright, brisk Merlot. A shower of cranberry acidity jolts the palate and cuts through the fine, but penetrating tannins that fringe the finish. An elegant, refreshing example of a cool-climate Merlot. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The best of the new releases from Michael Florentino, which has changed hands since this vintage was harvested. Autumnal flavors marry vivid, distinctive fruit to hints of leaf and citrus, elegant and complex. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There's so much oak on this Pinot Noir, you might think you were tasting a dessert made with vanilla cream and toasted meringue, like the crust on a baked Alaska. Under all that, loads of ripe raspberries and cherries. Shows the excellent hallmarks of a fine Santa Rita Pinot Noir, but certainly is one of the oakier versions. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This simple red is a great food wine, and it would pair with just about anything containing meat or cheese. It has heft and determination, with bright accents of cherry, red rose and dried apple. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Smooth and dry, with appealing flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar, and a fine, spicy finish. Shows amazing style and elegance for the price. A real sommelier's bargain, with 2,853 cases produced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Difficult to find much to like here. Smells baked and Porty, and tastes overtly sweet in residual sugar, like cherry and raspberry jam. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This new Malbec is a soft, fruity, extremely dark wine, with scents of raisins and pretty fruit flavors of boysenberries and black cherries, with lighter streaks of coffee and caramel woven through. The balance is excellent, though the wine does not show the depth of flavor that is expressed in its inky dark colors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fogarty's basic '05 Chard shows an exciting crispness and minerality that, good as it is, makes you long for the single-vineyard bottlings to come. There's an elegant angularity to the wine despite the succulent pineapples, kiwis and new oak, and a brisk acidity that makes it finish vibrantly clean. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Spicy, toasty wine, the fruit tropically rich. The texture is dense, the acidity important but not dominant. Delicious wine, now maturing well. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"The color of oxblood, this meaty, tannic wine pours espresso, black licorice and composted earth around tart blackberry fruit. It's aromatic, spicy and nicely balanced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Delicious and inviting with notes of eucalyptus, chocolate-covered cherries and wild raspberries on the nose. The palate exhibits darker flavors by way of black cherry and plum, fleshing out the solidly structured medium weight mouth. A moderate, evolving finish closes nicely with a kiss of sweet oak. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Oak dominates this wine, withstrong notes of buttered toast, vanilla and sweet char. There's nothing wrong with those pleasant aromas and flavors, but the underlying wine, with its cherry and currant fruit, is overpowered by the wood. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fruity and easy, this soft wine has sweet flavors of apricots and caramel. Valdiguié, formerly known as Napa Gamay, is a red grape, and that accounts for the note of crushed raspberries. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"It's not a bad name for this vineyard—Charmes. This wine, which expresses the nature of the vineyard, is certainly approachable, friendly almost. But there's also a steel fist there that demands time. And if you can't wait, it's a great wine to drink now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Very lush and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cassis flavors, with an oaky overlay, and there's a minerality toward the end that smacks of the soil. With an acidic jamminess and fierce tannins, the wine feels austere and remote. Give it 6 or 7 years in the cellar to come around. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Enticing spicy, toasty aromas and robust, dry fruit flavors are matched by very firm, fine-grained tannins in this full-bodied wine. Based on 65% Zinfandel, it has lots to offer, but at this stage an oaky sensation and the astringent mouthfeel indicate that it needs to mellow. Best to drink after 2018. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A bit earthy and dry, with rich blackberry, tobacco and cedar flavors and a cherry-chocolate edge. Nice, firm tannins round out the finish. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A little sweet, which makes the wine less subtle, this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend has jammy raspberry, cherry and vanilla smoke flavors. The finish is very sweet. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This pure Mourvèdre begins well, offering a full palate of varietal flavors that are built upon a mix of citrus and ripe tree fruits, along with accents of leaf and forest. It turns soft and seems a bit overripe, running into a rather short finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a bright-fruited wine with lively acidity and apple flavors. It has a creamy texture, a touch of spice and a lemon zest aftertaste. Drink now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This wine's excellently layered yet light nose mixes pomelo skin with tangelo and lime-spritzed pink-apple notes. The palate is extremely nervy, with grippy lemon-skin texture and squeezed-citrus flavors, all balanced by riper apple. It's like biting into a cold, crisp, just-ripe pear or nectarine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The most impressive of the fine range of wines from this producer, the wine is structured and dense without ever losing sight of balance, fruit and acidity. That makes for a wine that has a dusty texture coupled with a dry center of fruit and wood tannins. The acidity and the juicy berry fruits give freshness. Everything is ready for long aging. Drink from 2019. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"From the Gravina appellation in Puglia (southern Italy), this charming blend of Greco (60%) and Malvasia (40%) opens with easy aromas of pear, Golden Delicious apple and drying mineral or talc powder. It's tonic and fresh in the mouth and would pair with tomato bruschetta and fresh basil. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Ripe but minerally, all flint and crisp fruit along with the richness from the structure and green plum and wood flavors. This blending of fruit from a number of Chablis Premier Cru vineyards shows the rich, ageworthy nature of 2005. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"The appellation is near the western, cooler part of Paso Robles, and the wine's rich chocolate fudge and creamy cherry and cassis flavors have the requisite acidity and tannins needed to temper them. Almost sweet on the finish, the wine redeems itself with elegance. The high alcohol isn't really a problem, in terms of balance. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An exquisite wine that combines delicacy and harmony with enormously fruity-spicy flavors that fill the mouth. The aromas suggest candied ginger, tropical fruits, vanilla and wildflowers. The flavors are effusively fruity and on the dry side, with refreshingly crisp acidity. Try it with Asian-Pacific fusion foods. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very soft and direct, this Syrah offers lush flavors of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate, smoky oak and pepper. It seems at its best now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Chris Dowsett makes just a single Gewürztraminer each year, always from Celilo vines planted in 1982. 2010 was the coolest vintage in two decades at this high-altitude site. If you love searing acidity, married to varietal spice, rose petals, lemons, grapefruit, star fruit and gooseberries, you are in for a treat. Fermented in neutral French oak and left on the lees, this could age for decades. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rubesco Riserva is a dark and sophisticated wine (a 70-30 blend of Sangiovese and Canajolo) with big aromas of red fruit and exotic spice. This vintage (2003 was an exceptionally hot year) shows extra ripeness on the fruit and a touch of bitterness on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This debut blend somehow reaches 15% alcohol, not easy to do with Yakima Valley Sangiovese. It's a solid effort, which opens well—supple and polished, with pretty flavors of mixed plum and berry. It's silky, smooth and there's plenty of tangy fruit. The finish gets a little too hot, but that's a minor quibble in a wine that gives you this much flavor at this price. The finish keeps getting more and more interesting, piling on smoked ham and spicy clove as it goes. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a nice Chardonnay to drink with shellfish, particularly grilled shrimp. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with rich pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, accented with sweet, toasty oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This unusual wine displays notes of cigar box, strong green herbs and woodspice. It drinks on the lighter side of medium bodied with coffee and nori flavors and a smoke-filled finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of roses, lychee and pineapple, followed by appealing flavors of lemon, tropical fruit and flowers, give this wine a flirty but poised character. It's balanced and fresh, and best paired with summer salads and spicy ethnic cuisine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the grapes for this stunning wine came from David Abreu's vineyard in the St. Helena foothills. It's very complex, softer, more open and approachable than Colgin's 100% Cabs, with a flamboyant spectrum of cherries,  framboise, cocoa, violets, gingerbread and spices framed in supple, fine tannins. Beautiful, a feminine wine of great beauty. Drink now through 2015. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a bright Friulano with a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, peach and passion fruit. The wine tastes soft and supple in the mouth and delivers loads of fruity peach flavors on the close. What's nice about this wine is that it delivers high structure and lively fruit fragrances at the same time. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Opens with a nice nose of roasted nuts, banana, caramel and a hint of smoke. The palate's pear, baked apple and apricot flavors wear interesting coconut accents, but all these are unfortunately overrun by a scotch notes peek out from behind an edgy acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"You'll notice a unique and terroir-driven note of freshly milled white peppercorn that distinguishes this Amarone. In the background are generous tones of berry, black mineral and toasted almond. Pair this extraordinary wine with roasted meat or aged cheese. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A bouquet dominated by banana with some spicy vanilla notes and more banana in the mouth. Has more persistence than most Grigios, with a lean, spicy finish. Imported by Opici Import Company. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"As with its Momtazi vineyard bottling, Boedecker Cellars produced just two barrels of this Cherry Grove designate. It's a fragrant and focused effort, scented with rose petals and cherry candy, and carrying a spicy cinnamon streak into a textural, cola-laced finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Shows very ripe black currant flavors that veer into raisins and prunes, while the smoky oak adds a caramelized layer that makes the wine taste Port-like. But it's dry, with crisp acids. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet and Refosco that's aged in French oak, this opens with bold, black intensity, bearing notes of dark fruit, ripe blackberry and sweet spice. The mouthfeel is chewy and soft, with a touch of pulpy sweetness on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Sweet-pea vines and green herbs add freshness to the perfumed flower and luscious peach-nectar notes. A classically-styled Pinot Gris, this is dry yet mouthfilling and rich. It finishes long, with notes of stone fruit and black tea leaves. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Luscious, long, full-bodied and rich, a wonderful wine that showcases its appellation. Has well-ripened flavors of blackcurrants and cassis that drink long and deep, although there's some hollowness, which costs it a few points. The flavors are wrapped in soft, easy but complex tannins. Fully dry and nicely oaked, this wine is immediately enjoyable. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A terrific mouthfeel highlights this mix of berry and cherry fruits, toast and cinnamon. Tart and focused, it was aged in roughly half new French oak for the first 10 months, then transferred to neutral barrels for another five months. Fine-grained tannins give it an elegant finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rich in cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors, this Rhône blend has sweet-and-sour berry-cherry flavors. It's rich in dry, furry tannins. Needs something big and meaty to soften it, like beef stew. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Could almost be a Zinfandel, it's so jammy-fruity in raspberries, cherries, red currants and pepper, with firm tannins and a solid dose of acidity. It's also slightly sweet and one-dimensional. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"One of two Tempranillos from Fenestra (the other from Lodi), the Livermore Valley version is bright, tasting of cherry spice, with good acidity. Nearing the finish the taste turns to toasty dark molasses; a nice wine overall. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Almost stewy but not totally over the top. The nose offers more earth and oak than brightness, while the palate is herb-infused, with berry and tomato. Fairly classic in style, but not as fresh as desirable. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A useful Zin, rich and sweet and savory. Blended for complexity with Syrah and Petite Sirah, it's satisfying in black cherry, red licorice and cola flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and baking spices. Easy to drink with barbecue, burgers and such. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Similar to Petite Sirah, this is a dark, full-bodied red wine with significant tannins. It's dry, with berry, currant and spice flavors, and kind of rustic. Calls to mind barbecue. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A pure, varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, from a mix of Walla Walla vineyards. With a great Cabernet vintage, a new consulting winemaker (Robert Smasne) and excellent fruit sources, Skylite Cellars hits a real high note here. Lush black cherry fruit is framed in ripe, chewy tannins; the wine is dense and textural, with hints of herb and alcohol at a moderate 13.5%. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine from one of Anderson Valley's pioneers has a lighter-than-usual color and plenty of red cherry, raspberry and turned earth aromas. It offers low-level fruit flavors and good balance of acidity versus ripeness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors. It's notable for grippy tannins that give it a firm, dry mouthfeel. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, Campobello's entry-level red is slightly muddled, but it does a good job of offering genuine fruit flavors and overall freshness. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is bone dry, with plenty of acidity and tough tannins. It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue. But you have to consider its origin in Yountville, a cool area noted for ageable wines. It hould begin to resolve its difficulties by 2016. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An elegant Cabernet that's ready to drink tonight and will hold for some years. Shows good Napa character, with lush, ripe tannins and flavors of black currants, blackberries and cedar that cry out for a good steak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From a vineyard called Sweetwater, this Riesling itself is sweet in peach, pineapple and wildflower honey flavors. Brisk Monterey acidity balances, with a tart, prickly mouthfeel. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Too heavy and soft, like a melted mocha-raspberry sundae. Lacks structure, which makes it taste too sweet. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Perfumed fruits offer a ripe counterpoint to the solid tannins. Dark cherries, a touch of wood and layers of acidity come together well, leaving the chance to age further. Drink until 2020. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Easy to like for its crisp, mouthwatering acidity and flavors of lemons and limes, figs and vanilla. A nice, everyday wine to drink with roast chicken or as a cocktail sipper. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A rustic wine with strong, edgy tannins and modest cherry and coffee flavors. It's very dry and astringent, but will soften with beef. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Slightly gaseous on the nose and losing freshness with each passing day. Zingy acids are keeping it alive but the flavors are slipping toward cranberry and tomato. Not much else is left. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Cometa boasts a brilliant, saturated golden color and carries through with clean execution in terms of aromas and flavors. Notes of tropical fruit and ripe citrus come into sharp focus thanks to Fiano's natural minerality. In the mouth, it offers plenty of weight, but balances that with great length on the finish, hinting at anise, honey, limes and oranges. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is pure Sémillon, barrel fermented in new American oak, from a new, Spokane-based winery. Sémillon makes some of the best white wines in Washington, though consumer interest has been tepid. This shows the barrel influence with a rich coconut flavor, wrapped into sleek fruit flavors of white peach, green apple and a hint of cucumber. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dry as a bone, with bristling minerality, this is an elegant rosé that balances penetrating strawberry, cherry and plum flavors with sharp, lime-tinged acidity and a hint of wildflower. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The Cabernet Sauvignon is from vines planted in 1972—fruit that once went into Leonetti Cab. The other half is evenly split between Merlot and Cab Franc, crafting a flavor mix of herb and earth, with moderate density. It's nicely spiced, with brambly red fruits, and some butterscotch coming into the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very ripe and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling cherries and raspberries, with a rich seasoning of cinnamon, brown sugar and cocoa. But it's technically dry, and has a crispness from fine Arroyo Seco acidity. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The nose is heady and fragrant, edged with dried chamomile and hay flowers and subdued honey. Underneath that is a notion of sweet, luscious apricot compote. With time, there are the most subtle notes of enticing pine resin and fir honey—lit and illuminated all the way by the purest and most concentrated of lemon acidity. A triumph of balance and richness. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Medium-intense scents of dark berries and black plum unfold in the bouquet of this wine, with soft hints of vanilla, toast and garrigue in the background. The mouthfeel is robust and gripping, with skin-driven fruit flavors and solid tannins that stay through the finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Perfumed, floral and intriguing, this is still tight with mountain tannins. In a few years, its thick black-cherry and pepper tones will emerge, becoming rounded out with notes of violet and oaky leather. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Nasty. Hits the mouth with astringent green flavors and turns harsher and more bitter on the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A ripe and rich Barbera d'Asti Superiore with pleasantly inviting aromas of ripe blackberry, Maraschino cherry and exotic spice. All those aromatic layers are washed clean over the palate thanks to the wine's fresh acidity that kicks in on the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"They held this Cab-Sangiovese blend back, but it's still awkward. It's clean and fruity, but way too sugary sweet for a dry table wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Defines a style entirely separate from Napa's. Has those rustic Dry Creek tannins and even a briary edge to the blackberries and cherries, and is totally dry. Well-made and elegant. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Pinots from this vineyard, which is between the Anderson and Alexander valleys, always seem earthy and tannic in youth, and so it is with this bottling. With oak-inspired cherry, cola, tobacco and spice flavors, it could develop bottle complexity in 4–6 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Robust and full-bodied, with jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants, liberally sprinkled with crushed black pepper and cocoa. Dry and tannic, it's a Bordeaux blend, with Sangiovese and Syrah. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The Lirano Soprano Barbera d'Alba is ripe with aromas of coffee and freshly ground espresso bean, followed by chocolate and a playful touch of white pepper. The fruit tones hold up nicely to round off the bouquet and the wine balances richness and freshness. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Fragrant and ripe, this brightly colored cab franc mixes flavors of pomegranate, red currant, spicy cherry and red apple. Forward and nicely fruity, it leaves out the new oak and finishes clean and crisp. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fine ripe fruit shows on this full-flavored wine, but there is as much of the vanilla, toast and spice character as there is of the peach note. The texture, though, is all fruit, tight apple skins with final fresh acidity. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"One thing you can depend on concerning Clos du Val's Cabernets is that they're elegant. The winery resolutely refuses to kowtow to the modern style of ultraripe, extracted fruit, high alcohol and massive oak. This lovely Cab, which contains a drop of Merlot, defines their style, and is a joy to drink. It has rich, complex cherry and blackberry flavors, flecked with earth and herbs, and is just beginning a long journey. Now–2021, at least. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A lovely Riesling made in the off-dry style of a fine German Kabinett. It's crisp and sleek in acidity, with a mineral undertow to the peach, pineapple, gardenia and petrol flavors. Very pretty and polished with pan-fried trout almondine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An easy drinking dinner wine, dry and balanced, with smooth tannins and plum, blackberry and coffee flavors. Has a rich, blueberry-muffin taste on the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An oaky, hearty wine that in many ways wants to be Chardonnay. The nose exudes fresh-cut wood, while the flavor profile is all about buttered toast, apple and peach. Stylistically, it's California all the way, yet there's enough acid and natural flavor to help it from being too heavy. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ribolla Gialla is a naturally creamy, soft variety, but this expression favors tonic soda aromas and tart lemon candy that help shape a racy and zesty impression overall. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"There is no lack of oak barrel scents and accents here—chocolate and toast, layered around light strawberry fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The problem with this wine is the wood. There is too much of it, and the toasting is too high, giving a burnt character to the wine. For a 2005, this should be better integrated, and is likely to just dry out. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is a well-balanced wine that is both crisp and breezy and full of delicious red-berry fruits. It has a tight texture, with some minerality and a tangy aftertaste. This should make for an excellent apéritif. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Crisp strawberry, rose petal, peach flesh and a wet cement aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a winery just behind Cambria. The palate tingles with acidity, delivering ripe nectarine and plum flesh flavors, further enlivened by a touch of sea salt. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smells very earthy and funky, with a strong hit of green pepper. More bell pepper and some cracked black pepper appear on the palate, which features some currant, licorice and lots of oak. Bright acidity helps it along, but it just can't escape its vegetal core, which holds it back. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With just 2% Syrah, this is a Bordeaux-style blend, feauturing mostly Cabernet and Merlot. The rich entry features berry, chocolate and espresso, with a round midpalate and polished tannins. A hint of tar runs through the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This, the second wine from Clos de la Maréchale, is light, very fresh, dusty in texture, the tannins held in suspension, with red plum and cranberry flavors. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Great price for this unoaked white wine. It's smooth and crisp in mouthwatering acidity, with ripe flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, minerals and vanilla that finish with a honeyed richness. Easy to find, with production of 21,696 cases. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Light ruby in color, this offers fresh raspberry and red cherry aromas, slightly softer flavors of ripe plum and a smooth texture. It is medium bodied and easy to enjoy. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors. It has good acidity and a firm structure that should hold it together for three or four years. With aging, it may integrate and develop further. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Decent and crisp, with waterered-down citrus flavors. Finishes a little sweet. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"For the price, you get a Cabernet that shows some pretty good Napa character. It's ripe and forward with black currants with tough tannins and a hit of sweet oak. Lots going on, and could even age for a few years. If you drink it now, give it a couple hours of airing. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Comes down on the rustic side, but for the price it's pretty good for a dry Cabernet. Shows the variety's full-bodied fanciness in the blackberry, currant, cocoa and licorice flavors, with a rich steak of vanilla oak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Wet slate minerality leads the brisk, tightly wound nose. On the palate, the wine is a bit perfumed, at least for how tight the nose is, with elements of crisp apple, pear and a touch of nectarine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"So good, it makes you want to shout. Possesses the beautifully ripe flavors that are expected of a great vintage, such as blackcurrant, cherry, white chocolate and cassis, with extra edges of smoky caramel and vanilla. The tannins are perfect, soft and easy, but as rich and complex as a Renoir. Differentiates itself from Napa with its softness and accessibility, but as great as anything from across the Mayacamas. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A feminine wine, soft, gentle and delicious in flavor. Feels light and silky in the mouth, with rich notes of cherries, raspberries, cotton candy, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood. Almost sweet, but it finishes nice and dry. Drink now–2013. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This youthful expression of Dolcetto offers a dark, concentrated style and a very noticeable mineral tone that slices through the lush blueberry and raspberry aromas. The wine is tonic and vibrant and although there isn't huge complexity here, there is a good, fresh quality of fruit. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Light and citrusy, this off-dry Riesling features pleasant floral and spice notes that just lack a little zip on the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Bold and full bodied, this offers aromas of steeped plum, prune, clove and blue flower. The concentrated, savory palate doles out mature blackberry, raisin, clove and licorice. Big but velvety tannins and just enough freshness give this a surprisingly drinkable quality that belies its heft. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins. It's a fight to the finish—fruit or tannin—and too soon to pick a winner. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very pure—this has a straight line of acidity right to the wine's citrus- and pineapple-flavored heart. It is structured and taut, with its acidity dominant. It is concentrated and ready to age for 2–3 years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is a strong, oaky, ripe Chardonnay, grown on a mountain better known for Cabernet. It's powerful and intense in pineapple tart, pear marmalade, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that have been liberally oaked, and it shows the creamy influence of lees. Not particularly subtle, it's a wine you don't want to drink too cold. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity. Some pretty flavors here, with lots of spice and soft tannins. Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo is enhanced with a small percentage of Merlot. That addition heightens the wine's softness and renders a richer mouthfeel. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Sweet meets earthy, with aromas that recall grilled beets, cola and sassafras. The bottling comes from the father-son team of Tondré and Joe Alarid, who planted their vineyard in 1997 and combined have nearly a century's worth of farming experience in the Salinas Valley. Homemade cranberry sauce wins the palate, and the wine has more tannins than most Pinot Noirs of similar age. Enjoy now or cellar until 2016 for even more emerging flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There's a lot to like about this Viognier. It's dry and zesty in acidity, with complex flavors of citrus, peach, kumquat, white pepper, chamomile and honey. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Marion makes some of the best Amarone on sale today and this standout expression from the stellar 2004 vintage proves the point. The wine is thick, deliciously succulent and redolent of mature black fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and pipe tobacco. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A pale pink sparkler with loads of intensity and elegance, Essence opens with delicate aromas of cranberry, toasted almond, mature fruit and grapefruit. The wine's perlage is steady and foamy. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Hard to keep from falling in love with this wine. It's so luscious in bright, spicy wild cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors. With a satiny texture and brilliant acidity, it's stunningly drinkable now, but should hold and develop over the next six years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Oxidative and spicy. Effusive mineral notes provide complexity but turn heavy in the mouth without fruit for balance. Crisp, with a silky texture and a short-to-medium finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"One wishes that Mike Januik made more Rieslings, as the few he's made from Bacchus Vineyard fruit have been excellent. This is made in a bright, spicy, palate-pleasing style, and it offers lively flavors of citrus, orange and pear. A hint of mint, a splash of jasmine tea, and an engaging, long, refreshing finish all add to the pleasure. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rich and toasty, this has aromas barrel-dominated aromas and flavors of vanilla and sweet, buttery oak. The underlying wine is strong in cherry and balsam flavors, which are girded by considerable tannins. Pair this with game meats, stews or barbecue to wrestle the structural elements into submission. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a terrific value wine (a rosé made from the indigenous grapes of Sicily) that opens with a bright pink color and fragrant tones of raspberry, white almond and rose petal. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this robust wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature plum, toast and roasted coffee bean. The palate offers prune, dried cherry, black pepper, graphite and espresso alongside dusty tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the midpalate. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Gold in color, with a ton of oak. But you know what? It works. The resin and vanilla aromas over time become attractive, while the rich palate deals coconut, toffee and baked white fruits. Yes, it's a barrique bomber from a hot climate, but it's interesting and should go well with roast fowl or foie gras. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This has some real strength to the fruit, which shows depth, nerve and muscle. There's a nice high note suggesting citrus, even grapefruit; below that some racy berry fruit flavors; then comes the impact of tannin and espresso. It all adds up to some real excitement in the mouth. A powerful wine that zings the palate and leaves you wanting more. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There's a wild, feral quality to this fine Pinot Noir. It has forest flavors of wild mushrooms, thyme, fennel, anise and pine, along with more familiar flavors of red cherries, cola and sandalwood. Elegant and ageable. Now through 2012. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Starts off with melon and a touch of almond character, then adds brighter pineapple notes that turn tart and metallic on the finish, a poignant counter to the wine's breadth on the palate. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Cantina Tre Serre is a well-priced and informal Barbera with a thin and informal style backed by fruity freshness. There's even a tiny touch of effervescence that adds a perky and peppery sensation to the mouthfeel. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101. With good acidity, it's a very respectable table wine from a weak vintage. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Truckloads of fresh banana emerge from the nose, and are backed by vanilla bean, chalky minerality and some vitamin-like aromas. Somewhat dilute on the palate, but those banana notes put in another strong appearance. Imported by Vias Imports. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Really charming, with a nose of green plums, red berries and earth that jumps out of the glass and curls up in your lap. The palate is lacking a bit in intensity but makes up for it with iresistable cassis flavor followed by fresh-roasted coffee. The bracing acidity would be well matched by a cheese-laden dish such as lasagna. Drink now to one year. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Coming from a vineyard first planted by Mondavi in the late 1990s, this well-priced and widely available wine shows blackberry, violets, black pepper and just snapped dark chocolate on the nose. Fresh, lively black cherries and blueberries meld with fennel, tarragon and lots of herbal spice, all held together by smooth tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Broad across the palate, this brings flavors of orange soda and orange candy, with a grainy impression. It's fruit forward, with a quick fade. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A very nice Chardonnay that has the dusty, herbal tug that Napa Chards often display. Otherwise it's very rich, with potent pineapple pie and peach tart flavors, enriched with creamy lees and buttery new oak. Drink now–2012. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The 79% Syrah component is estate-grown; while the 21% Grenache comes from the Lonesome Springs vineyard. What a lovely nose, with the bright and grapey Grenache shining through and adding pretty floral scents, while the Syrah fills in the berries and peppery tannins. This is still quite purple and youthful, fresh and just a bit volatile. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a pure Cab Franc, stylish and varietal. The new oak was limited to just 30%, giving a kick to the natural toastiness of the grape. The fruit mixes blueberries, black cherry and a streak of cassis, then runs into luscious mocha and espresso, with highlights of black pepper and cedar. The tannins have been beautifully managed. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Briny citrus, feline notes and pithy scents send this Merseguera-led blend toward a pulpy, citrusy palate. Grapefruit and pithy, lightly bitter flavors finish citric, with little change from the wine's primary flavors. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Here's a luminous and bright Chardonnay with a well-balanced aromatic offering that spans from toasted nut to chalky mineral to exotic fruit. Overall, the wine tastes smooth and creamy, but there are a few sharp points of acidity that help move it along the palate. It's a sophisticated white wine in a very elegant bottle. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Soft, ripe and decadent, this Pinot, from the Napa side of Carneros, brims with blackberry, cherry, cola, vanilla, licorice and cinnamon spice flavors. It's full-bodied, but has Pinot's elegant silkiness. At its best now and for a couple years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Light raspberry along with charred wood carries the modest nose. Additional raspberry flavors blend with sweeter strawberry tastes to create a mildly creamy, easygoing palate. Finishes fairly buttery, with toast and popcorn notes. An attempt at a major-league wine that is semi-successful. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Very dark espresso, leather and black plum aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is full and balanced by good acidity. The very dry, long finish shows tar, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors, along with some tannins to shed. Time should allow the solid fruit to come from behind the lavish toast that now veils it. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Dripping in earth, kir and fresh raspberry, this is a stellar wine from the heart of the appellation, estate-grown from a four-acre spot planted to a trio of clones. Spirited and refreshing, it dances in acidity and a floral back note that's compelling, wrapped in cinnamon and mocha. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's an absolutely terrific, but informal sparkling rosé from southern Italy (made with Negroamaro grapes). Sweet berry, chopped mint and peach come to the fore and the wine is soft and slightly sweet. It's easy, fresh and would make a great cocktail choice. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A refined and complex Syrah from the “Grand Cru” of Minervois la Liviniere. Raspberry, blueberry, rosemary and thin mint flesh out the velvety texture, supported by a solid backbone of gripping tannins and balanced acidity. Coffee and cocoa notes develop on the lush, lingering finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A lovely and complex Cabernet from this mountain in the southerly Mayacamas chain. It shows the big, firm tannins of its origins, with a dry sturdiness backing up the intense black currant flavors. Drinkable now for sheer decadence, although it also seems to have the stuffing to age for a decade. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An upscale white wine made in the white Bordeaux style. It was partially aged in oak, on the lees, bringing a creamy, yeasty freshness to the citrus, tropical fruit and green grass flavors that are totally dry. Brisk acidity makes for a clean scour. A brilliant wine to drink with everything from goat cheese appetizers through firm fleshed fish like halibut to roast chicken. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Talcum powder, orange peel and a bit of fresh-cut grass make for a pleasant bouquet. Quite forward and fully charged on the palate; there's melon, apple and lemon as well as some softer peach flavors. Good and lively. Imported by Vineyard Brands. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"As sweet as Port, with chocolate and prune flavors. Feels as hot as a chile pepper, with nearly 17% alcohol. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Ripe and soft, with smooth toast-inspired texture and blackberry fruits on the rich side. It is still young, needing another year to pull firmly together, but its elegance already shows. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. The aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, cherry and spice are subdued while the palate brings a somewhat elegant style, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Hot in high alcohol, which gives a burn that accentuates the pepper spice and makes it fierce. Yet it's fully dry and rich in blackberry, blueberry, anise and tobacco flavors. Defines the California superripe Zinfandel style. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ripe, open and packed with melon and tropical fruit flavors, this wine is already showing enticing drinkability. Its fresh, ripe fruits is layered with some mineral character and an under-cushion of wood. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This Malbec is so dry, tannic and acidic that it's impossible to enjoy it on its own. There's a core of blackberries, but wow, what a tough wine. Decant it for a few hours and try it with barbecue. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Starts out nice, with a good, fruity raspberry nose, but on the palate are tastes of tomatoes, with a dry, astringent, tannic finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Bold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates. There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This relatively dark-colored rosé features nicely perfumed aromas of fruit blossoms and black cherries, then adds a hint of dark chocolate to the palate. It's fullish, but not heavy, balanced by some lemony notes on the finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A pretty wine with aromas of black-cherry liqueur and a dash of espresso, or maybe it's the other way around. Round, full and lushly flavored. The high acidity gives it real bite; in fact, the finish is somewhat bitter because of it. Food will soften it up nicely. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A powerfully ripe, toasty wine, showing all the richness of 2005 in Chablis, and adding a layer of structure to go with the apples and cream richness. At the center, there is green minerality. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This Montsant white is oily and oaky on the nose. The palate on this Garnacha Blanca is plump feeling, with decent acidity and full flavors of papaya and melon. This finishes oily in feel, with green notes and scallion flavors. Only 500 cases made. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"With each bump up in price, the winemaker ups the percentage of new oak; here it's 25%. Half the fruit is estate grown, and this light, clean, well-balanced wine drinks like a village Burgundy, with the right hint of herb around the tart red fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a lovely Morellino that delivers lively and easy aromas of cherry, blackberry and plum. As the wine is aged only in stainless steel to preserve its freshness, the integrity of the fruit is remarkable, and the mouthfeel is bright and focused. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"When first opened it is tight and herbal, with the scent of blood. But the subtle hints of rock and spice that underlie the pristine cranberry fruit need some years to unwrap themselves. This new 2006 Schindler comes out swinging, its wild berry fruit laced with earthy, barnyard funk. Tastes like an unbridled mix of fruit and soil, spice and barrel, that adds up to a vibrant, earthy, alive Pinot. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Just touching maturity, this is a wonderful wine. With intense acidity, yeast, minerality and a beautiful final citrus texture, this is ready to drink but will age for many years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is so delicious and classic, it's totally enjoyable now, but it has the structural balance to age for quite a while. It impresses for the complex blackberry, currant and cedar flavors and for the quality of the tannins, which are dramatically rich and ripe. Best now and for at least 10 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Wood aging adds a smoky character and toasty flavor, while also smoothing out the tannins. From the rich 2009 vintage, this wine shows both plum fruits and firm tannins. It could still age, drink until 2018. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Fresh crispness is what you notice first in this luminous and bright Soave. Made from Garganega grapes, the wine boasts aromas of lemon zest, white mineral and pear. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Distinctive aromas of beeswax and bee pollen continue with similar flavors, wrapped around tart yellow apple fruit. It's lovely, fragrant and ageworthy, in a high-acid Euro mold, but give it plenty of time to breathe. Decanting is a good idea. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriyaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a great value. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An absolute gem from respected Languedoc produer Gérard Bertrand. The aromas draw you in immediately with intense, brooding notes of coffee, black fruit preserves, cocoa and tea leaves. The mouth, like crushed velvet, offers more black plum and blueberry preserve notes while dusty tannins dance in your mouth. Garrigue spice lingers in the finish. Hold until 2010–2013. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A very perfumed ripe wine. The fruit flavors range from mango through peach to a taut citric finish. With just a hint of wood, this is a bright and fruity wine, delicious to drink now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Polished and balanced, this masterpiece shows restraint and it's already drinkable. With its great acidity and its fine intermingling of spice and red fruit flavors, this wine will appeal to lovers of Gamay and Pinot Noir. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Marked by zingy acidity, this Malbec shows Cabernet-like black currant flavors and strong, rich tannins. Bone dry, it needs a good steak to punch through the astringency. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This starts light, with wild berry and bramble flavors, but it's nicely balanced and persists across the palate with pleasant milk chocolate flavors. Well integrated with good acids, this 100% varietal Merlot is pleasurable and easy drinking. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Honey, peach, citrus and dried herbs comprise the nose of this simple Pinot Grigio. In appearance, the wine is almost transparent with a touch of gold and the mouthfeel is equally light and easy. The screwcap bottle has a cute picture of a green Vespa on the label to reinforce its all-Italy, Dolce Vita appeal. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A good Cabernet for drinking now, with polished tannins and candied flavors of blackberry pie filling, sour black cherry Lifesavers and sweet, smoky sandalwood. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Full of juicy red-fruit flavors, this is hugely rich. It is solid, chunky and concentrated, with jammy red-plum flavors marrying with firm tannins and intense acids. Expect this wine to age for six-plus years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Very floral and delicate, this is a wonderful Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting blend of floral and fruit aromas that come together in a generous, harmonious whole. It's easy and approachable and would pair well with lightly grilled sea bass or fresh water fish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Oddly sweet and medicinal, with sugary apricot and orange soda flavors and deficient acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished SB benefits from crisp acidity provoked by its cool growing region. The flavors are of figs, citrus fruits and nectarines, but they could be a bit more focused. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Mild peachy aromas are friendly but nothing serious or intense. This varietal Macabeo feels citrusy, while lightly bitter flavors of almond skins, citrus pith and green melon finish with simplicity and a note of nectarine. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Unfortunately only available in Bermuda, this wonderful bottling shows salted brambleberries, crushed violets, asphalt, rosemary and pinpointed florality on the fresh yet concentrated nose. The palate is zesty and darkly focused, with elderberries, stewed plums, thyme and Earl Grey tea. It's quite a complex effort. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The current downturn in demand for both grapes and expensive wines only helps A to Z; there is more good fruit to purchase, and plenty of demand at a $12 price point. This new Pinot Gris is fresh and racy, with a mineral-driven acidity underlying the clean fruit, tasting of pears and pear skin. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This beautiful wine further confirms the high level of quality in the Pinot Noirs from Dan Goldfield and Steve Dutton. It has a profusion of ripe black cherry and currant flavors, backed by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins, giving it grip. Its balance of concentrated fruit flavors and solid structure indicates a long life in the cellar. Best after 2020. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Lasagna, meat-filled ravioli or mushroom risotto would make good pairing partners to this mild and crisp red. It offers notes of red berry, almond and cola. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Harmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Young and yeasty, this is a style best consumed early. It refreshes like a light beer, quick and clean, with bracing acidity, but not much in the way of fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"While the surface of the wine is firmly tannic, the fruit brings in the richness and opulence underneath. The combination equals a ripe, wood-aged wine, with dry tannins that are beginning to integrate into the fruit. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Ouch. Tough, extremely dry, and acidic-tannic, this wine isn't showing much charm now. There's a suggestion of blackberry, bitter cherry and blueberry fruit, as well as lots of smoky oak. Nowhere near ready, and hard to predict. Try after 2008. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A mellow, well-rounded Petite that could almost be mistaken for blueberry tea, so prominent are those two strains of flavor in this wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a classic California interpretation of a southern Rhône-style blend. It's a good wine, smooth and pleasant if not particularly complex, offering rich flavors of cherry, cherry liqueur, cola, mocha, bacon and white pepper. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A curious wine. It's not tasting at all good now. So tannic, so new oaky, it feels clumsy and astringent and awkward in the mouth. Then you realize how rich the heart of fruit is, offering an enormous array of blackberries, blueberries and black currants. The grapes are from Rutherford. The gamble is if the fruit will outlast the tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here is a plush and elegant Barbera d'Alba with bright fruit tones followed by graphite, a dash of exotic spice and pretty earthy nuances. The wine is bright and fruity in the mouth with cherry and blackberry on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Having never tried this producer's wines, we can only heap praise on this medium-bodied, more modern style of Rioja. Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors. Firm and mildly tannic, with ample new oak leaving lasting flavors of vanilla, coffee and pepper. Hold for another year or so, if possible; 900 cases produced. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"A meaty Shiraz that pulls no punches, proudly displaying its black raspberry and earthy, salumi-infused flavors around a rich, dense texture full of leather and a touch of smoke. The Temecula Valley is continuing to make strides and this is a jumbo-jet-sized example that finishes a teensy bit sweet. The Shiraz is blended with 11% Cinsault. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Firm, solid, chunky, a great success from a château that is currently in top form, even in more difficult years. The bright fruits charge through the tannins, giving some richness, balancing with the elegance and freshness of the year. Worth aging. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Straightforward, this Chard shows well-ripened flavors of pineapple jam, nectarines, peaches and vanilla. It finishes with caramelized, butterscotchy sweetness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Greenwood Ridge often does a good job at Sauvignon Blanc, but not this year. The wine is irritating in unripe feline flavors and it's also off-dry, with 1.9% residual sugar. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Mainly Syrah, with a splash of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier, this polished wine is marked by things that are red: red cherries, red currants and red licorice. It's dry, full bodied and tannic. When you swallow, astrigency remains behind, with the aftertaste of crushed red pepper. Lovely and complex, it's a wine to decant. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A subtle note of caramel adds richness to the baked apple aromas on the nose. On the palate, hints of chamomile tisane add to the baked apple flavors. The body is taut and linear. Rounded hints of baked apple persist even on the dry, clean and fresh finish. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A sweet style of sparkling wine, with brisk acidity framing orange, lime, vanilla and honey flavors. Nice with wedding cake, at a good price. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This Zinfandel tastes and feels hot and Port-like. While some people enjoy this style, it feels a bit clumsy and overripe. Nonetheless, the blackberry, raisin and chocolate flavors are tasty. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a good price for a Cab so rich and supple. It's very deep in flavor, with flavors of blackberry pie filling, milk chocolate, anise and sweet oak, yet it's softly balanced and dry. Just delicious for drinking now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The wine's tan-gold color tells you that it's fading, the aromas of canned pineapple are not particularly fresh, and the finish is fleshy and fat. Imported by Alconde Vineyards, LLC. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"This is Goldeneye's basic appellation Pinot. It's fairly rich in cherries, raspberries, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood, with an elegantly crisp mouthfeel. But it lacks excitement, especially at this price. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness. There is also a more serious mineral texture that comes with tangy acidity. Age this wine for a few more months and drink from the end of 2017. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is a bright pink rosé with a full bouquet of berry and floral aromas but also a pungent point of chemical or solvent at the back that creates an awkward first impression. The wine is bright, firm and crisp on the palate. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Warm spice and oak tones accent fresh apples and lemons on this full-bodied Chardonnay. It's not subtle with a dense slick of caramel that extends along the midpalate, but a kick of lemon-lime acidity on the finish adds some levity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This lands on the sweet side of the corral, and has a good texture of tannins and acidity as well as oodles of grapy, blackberry jam flavors to complete the package. It's full bodied, rich in mouthfeel, and the ripe fruit character stays on the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The partner to Copains d'Abord, this wine sports a label of women having a good time at a party. The wine suits the image: fresh, fruity and juicy. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Full-bodied and dry. You can taste the Pinot Noir in the black and red cherry and red currant flavors. A bit rough in texture, but pretty good for the price. Will pair well with roast salmon or even a lamb chop. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Just a single barrel was made, pure Sangiovese from the Candy Mountain Vineyard. Tight, tart and dark, it captures black cherry fruit with black licorice and a whiff of smoke. At this point in time the tannins and acids seem to be fighting it out for control. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The score reflects the rich cherry, blackberry, cola and smoked meat flavors in this dry, crisp, silky wine. But it also takes into account a certain funkiness and one-dimensional simplicity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is cool on the nose, with tree bark and tobacco aromas that come together well. Tannic and stout, it's not punishing, with a roasted black-fruit flavor and a backing of espresso bitterness. This shows a syrupy side and also raw power. Drink now–2018. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Reflecting the heat of the vintage, aromas recall stewed prune, fig and toasted oak. The hearty but one-dimensional palate delivers dried berry, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and anisette alongside raspy, mouth-puckering tannins. Searing alcohol dominates the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This low-production Chardonnay shows the oaky, ripe notes. It has strong, forward tropical fruit, peach, lemon and lime flavors, with lots of buttered toast and vanilla bean.A firm minerality adds complexity. Drink up. ->","completion":" us"}

{"prompt":"Clean and approachable, with lemon-lime aromas leading to an easy, mildly crisp palate with lemon, lime and honeydew flavors. Sweet in accordance with standard extra dry guidelines, and also good for apéritifs and sparkling cocktails. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Our unanimous favorite of the tasting, La Prima comes from the oldest vines on the property, and is a blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino aged in barriques. Dark color, with black plums and hints of violets on the nose, the oak is understated, allowing the blackberry, plum and floral notes to shine through. Finishes rich, chewy and long. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"DDO's Chardonnay comes as close to white Burgundy as you will find in Oregon. Amazing finesse, with crisp, detailed aromas mixing flowers, peaches, melon and almonds. Impressive texture and a long, elegant and precisely-detailed path across the palate. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This bright Sauvignon offers an aromatic medley of stone fruit, papaya, dried hay and fragrant yellow rose. The wine has good structure and a polished, clean finish that would work with fried finger foods or mozzarella bites. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Starts out very light in mouthfeel, almost delicately simple, with such a dry, wispy texture that it feels almost inconsequential. Then you notice the flavors of cola, tart cherryskin, ripe rhubarb, coffee, Asian spices and caramelized oak. They mingle together in a complex swirl that makes you want another sip. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Soft and jammy, with raspberry and red licorice flavors and a streak of brambles, nettles and peppery spices. It's a good, dry wine, but would benefit from greater structure. A Syrah-based Rhône-style blend. ->","completion":" us"}
