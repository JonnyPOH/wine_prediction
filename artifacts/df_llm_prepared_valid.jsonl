{"prompt":"A very herbaceous character makes this wine seem rather thin. It's soft and lightweight, and the lemon zest character is mildly attractive. Ready to drink. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"From a site near Annapolis, this wine shows a preponderance of dark grape and cherry flavor interwoven with cinnamon and black peppercorn. Light-bodied and ethereally layered, it has touches of rustic earthiness and leather. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Bright, clean and linear with pretty accents of spice, blackberry, leather and lingering tobacco, Villa al Cortile Riserva is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with a hearty meat dinner. The wine shows velvety, soft texture in the mouth. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, the grapes are single vineyard, Rattlesnake Hills AVA fruit. The best of the Girly Girl lineup, though the promising beginning (cassis and berry, scented with black olive and herb) quickly fades into a forest floor finale of decaying leaves. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Like a photocopy of a photocopy, this thinned-down Pinot Noir contains only a suggestion of the real thing. It's dry, but watery in cherry-cola flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Spicy and dry, this Zin offers flavors of currants, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. The tannins are thick, but acidity is low, giving it a soft mouthfeel. Could be more concentrated, but it's an elegant wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"One of the first 2008 Pinots to be released, this fresh young wine has Beaujolais Nouveau-like flavors of freshly crushed cherries, with tangy acidity. It's a fun wine to drink with a juicy cheeseburger. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ripe orange, lime and honey flavors combine with tingly, mouth-watering acidity to give this dry Chardonnay a sweet-and-sour taste. It's an easy wine to drink with mushroom risotto, garlic shrimp, chicken fajitas. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The shade of this Kathy Joseph creation is that of rosé-colored sunglasses. Such comfort is furthered with a cherry cola and maraschino cherry nose. A slight effervescent zing on the palate accompanies pomegranate flavors followed by an impressively long finish. Great with a fresh garden salad, but able to handle more substantial fare too, such as  breaded chicken cutlets or a cheeseburger. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Overt and round, with chunky aromas of berries and stone fruits. Quite lively and zesty, with purity of flavors. Is it a touch limited in scope and complexity? Yes. But the nectarine and orange flavors are crystalline and the mouthfeel rocks. Imported by Vranken America. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Yeasty, bready aromas of cantaloupe and citrus feed into an undefined palate that foams up on tongue. Citrus and melon flavors are bland, with powdered sugar and orange notes on the finish. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"At first this Chaleur Estate seemed closed up tight and lightly herbal, but grudgingly opened with streaks of olive, chalk, coffee grounds. A second bottle was much brighter, layered with plum, cherry, chocolate, herb, and an impression of pepper. Subtle and sleek, this wine is built to age and needs to be decanted. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dark and deep, with cola, black fruit and truffle aromas. There's good lift to the palate, but overall it has to be classified as a dense, warm-climate wine with a big body and equally large flavors of black plum, olive and coffee. Seems short and a little simple on the finish. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"The simplest and fruitiest of the Cahors made at Gaudou, this is still a structured wine that has some firm, very young tannins that need to round out. Plenty of fruity, fresh black-currant flavor is cut by crisp acidity. The wine will need to age, so drink from 2016. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Nice and dry, with lots of black pepper-infused wild blackberry flavors wrapped into big but pliant tannins. Lots of crunchy acidity, too, which makes the wine sharp. Will be great with a rich steak. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Comes on a bit flat, with a streak of cardboard under the fruit. Not as fresh as it should be, given the vintage. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Feels soft and cloyingly sweet in pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, and is beginning to be tired and old. Drink up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Lightly fruity and fresh, a wine that has some crisp acidity although without much definition. The aftertaste is clean, bringing out attractive citrus and red currant fruits. Screwcap. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla. A fresh, citric palate delivers lime, green apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors, while the finish is clean as a new razor, with nothing off, bitter or pithy. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Lots of zesty acidity in this Pinot Noir, giving the pomegranate, rhubarb, red cherry and licorice flavors a bright edge. The wine is very dry and complexly layered. Interesting now, if a bit primary in fruit, and balanced enough to develop additional nuances over the next six years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Pungent of baked plum and baking spice, this Shenandoah Barbera is soft and rustic, yet refined, with a jolt of mocha espresso on the finish. The expert acidity enveloping this wine should pair with Mediterrean-themed food. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A mix of vineyards and AVAs go into this blended Syrah, which is co-fermented with 6% Viognier. The Viognier is definitely present, and the wine has a top end of grapefruit and citrus, adding scent, flavor and acid. It's full, forward, acidic and a little hot, and delivers plenty of flavor up front. What's not quite there is the layering of flavors that some of the other Walter Dacon Syrahs express. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A finely structured wine, its tannin fitting well into the rich texture, with berry fruits, dark plums and bitter coffee adding an extra dimension. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Nice and smooth, this Merlot is for early drinking. It's as plump as can be in cherries, cocoa, cola and tobacco, with soft acids and even softer tannins. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a firm and stony wine, with dry tannins that give structure to the intense acidity and the red cherry flavor. It's dense and concentrated, with a solid feel that demands several years of aging. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Blueberry fruit mingles with cinnamon-tinged oak spice on the nose and palate of this offering. There's even enough depth and complexity to make it more than a simple quaff, worthy of washing down simply roasted chicken perhaps. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"It's a rustic, slightly raisiny Bordeaux blend (with a little Syrah also), sourced from excellent vineyards, but a bit overripe. Soft, forward and a little leathery, it's ready to drink up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage. It's a wine that needs at least 5 years. Today, if you do open a bottle, watch for the mineral, stony character that pushes the fruit and demands attention. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Peppery and bright in acidity, this blend of half Grenache and lesser percentages of Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise is a bit mixed. On the one hand it offers red raspberry and pomegranate and perfumed aromatics; on the other hand, the earthiness detracts. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very tannic, rough. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This Chardonnay has brisk, crisp acidity and flavors of pineapple, orange and mango. There are dominating notes of buttered toast and sweet butterscotch. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine boasts an oak-driven character, with aromas of espresso, coffee and toasted almond. The palate shows red and black fruit layered with accents of oak, chocolate and black pepper. Technically well made, it's shy on personality and length. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A little too soft in both acidity and tannins to have perfect structure, but it's fine enough, and the flavors certainly are complex and compelling. They range from blackberry tart and cherry pie through Dr. Pepper cola and anise liqueur to bacon and sandalwood. If that sounds good, it is. Ready now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Syrah from coastal Tuscany opens with bright fruit, a somewhat lean texture and delivers lively berry notes of wild strawberry and white cherry. A good value, the wine would pair well with pizza or pasta. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Firm and compact, it mixes wild berry, plum and cassis fruits, giving this Cab-dominated blend the sleek appeal of a good St. Emilion, but without the aggressive herbaceousness. There is no obvious new oak here, but lovely suggestions of barrel that never override the superb fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Some wines have a personality that makes you want to smile. This is one of them. A big, rich, friendly wine full of fruit that was approachable and easy to drink. It is not particularly serious, nor should it be put down for long aging. But drink it now with a burger or roast chicken and it will give pleasure. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This is a syrupy, rich, meaty wine that opens with impressive intensity and extraction. It's a bruiser and a pleaser that delivers aromas of cherry liqueur, blackberry jam and exotic spice. It's also a masculine, opulent wine that could use a few more years of cellar aging. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine manages to combine some of the delicacy and elegance of Margaux with the richness of 2003. Under the direction of Claire Villars (also of Château Ferrière classed growth), there is a confidence in this estate and its vineyards which lie adjacent to Château Margaux. Great acidity and black fruits finish the ensemble. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A bit too oaky and extracted. Trades these winemaker elaborations for the natural subtlety of the grapes. Rich in cherries and raspberries, but heavy-handed. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is tart in acidity and tastes of raspberry jam, with a bubblegum-gassiness reminiscent of Beaujolais. It's easy and refreshing. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From a mix of vineyards, this tastes of berries, raisins, cooked plums, and baking spices. The tannins are hard and slightly bitter, and there seems to be a hint of residual sugar, perhaps to mitigate the bitterness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made with Sangiovese, Locorosso has an intense fragrance of wild cherry and underbrush accented by tobacco and spice. The palate is dense and delicious, delivering black cherry layered with carob, coffee and white pepper notes. It's already enjoyable so drink soon. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Very sweet and delicious, a true Port-style wine that's high in acidity and packed with tannins. But the sugar level is so high, it makes the wine drinkable now. The flavors are of chocolate, red currants and vanilla. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Although the vineyard is source to some very great bottlings by others, this one has a sharpness throughout that detracts. The green mint taste suggests unripe tannins to the red cherries and pomegranates. Unlikely to age, so drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This ripe, lush Syrah boldly expresses itself with shiny, saturated colors and bright, spicy, assertive fruit. It's a full-bodied, sappy wine, forward and plump, and the deep core of blackberry fruit is enhanced with pepper, citrus peel, clove and other spices. Young and still grapey, it's delicious right now but can be cellared for some years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fermented 75% whole-cluster and then aged in neutral oak, this wine offers complex, expressive aromas of green olive, fresh herbs, grilled asparagus, earth and peat. The palate brings waves of intensity, with sensuous, layered savory flavors that lead to a hyperextended finish. It's an exclamation point of a wine that shows the promise of this young winery and vineyard. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Lots of bang for the buck here. Offers mouth-filling, juicy blackberry, cherry, pomegranate and coffee flavors in a bone-dry, soft wine, with a fairly complicated tannin structure. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a very ripe wine stuffed with blackberries, cherries and cocoa, but it's also pretty tannic, although sweet oak softens the blow. Feels lush and good, but rustic around the edges. Drink now with beef dishes. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine opens with the fresh liveliness of stemmy earth and black tea notes, growing funkier and more herbal on the midpalate. Brightly layered and deeply flavored, it's a full-bodied rendition that remains true to its variety. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Cola, cherry, mocha and vanilla flavors, in a light-bodied, silky wine, with pronounced acidity. Finishes dry. A bit rustic, but offers good Pinot character. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Paleo (a pure expression of Cabernet Franc from Coastal Tuscany) is a drop dead gorgeous wine with amazing intensity and purity of aromas. You get it all here: Bright berry notes, drying mineral, exotic spice, cooling acidity and firm, satisfying structure. It's a rich, velvety and beautiful wine that will award you a memorable drinking experience now or in 10 years time. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This no-fuss blend of Chardonnay and Fiano offers simple tones of citrus and pear that segue to a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Pair this fresh southern Italian white with insalata di mare (seafood salad). ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Medium intense notes of sweet grass, fresh red apple slices, green melon and lime citrus on the nose and mouth. Medium weight with moderate, supporting acidity and a clean finish. Drink now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Ripe and fleshy in young fruit, this Cab, with minor amounts of Cab Franc and Merlot, shows black currant, plum, cherry and cedar flavors, with a dry-sweet dusting of crushed brown herbs and spices. Fairly tannic and tight now, it's balanced enough for mid-term aging. Best 2008–2012. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Intricate aromas and spicy, complex flavors make this medium-bodied wine an adventure to drink. It smells like cherries and cloves and wood smoke, tastes nicely ripe but dry, and has an appetizing, tannic grip in the texture. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Toasty, with notes of slightly menthol-like oak layered over ripe blackberry fruit. It's a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp, tart and mouthwatering. Give it another 6–12 months to better integrate the oak, then drink it over the next five or so years. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Brander has struggled with Merlot. This year's bottling achieve plenty of cherry-berry and mocha fruit. The challenge continues to be the tannic structure, but improvement is notable. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Get a case of this and make it your house wine for easy drinking. It's dry and spicy, and has enough cherry, berry and cola flavors to satisfy your tastebuds. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A bit rough and ready, but shows basic Cabernet quality in the full-bodied flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and smoky oak. Good for a tailgate party. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Von Strasser has a good track record with this wine, and the '05 is right up there with the best, but be forewarned. It's very tannic. But then, it is from Diamond Mountain. Give it a good 4 years, at least, to throw some sediment and let the rich blackberry and black currant flavors emerge. Should hold well for 15 years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Hot and unbalanced in fruit, with flavors that span the gamut from raisins to mint, this Zin is bone dry. It's a rustic wine, with some rugged tannins and a coarse finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rather tough and astringent now, with crunchy, dry tannins and acidity dominating. These are very fine vineyards but the vintage was so-so. With its core of cherries, red currants and cola, it could develop over the next six years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Simple, hot and sweet-and-sour, this is not a success. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Toasty, with a bit of cedar or menthol on the nose; red berries and licorice on the palate. The fruit here is delicate and tart, particularly on the finish, where the flavors are almost lemony. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An elegant, restrained, yet lovely Pinot Noir from a much-maligned vintage. Soft, round cherry fruit is wrapped in sandalwood and mocha flavors. Fully ripe with fine tannins and lovely integration of the barrel notes. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a genuine but simple interpretation of Barbera d'Asti Superiore with fresh fruit layers and vibrant tones of cherry, cranberry and pomegranate. This easy-pairing food wine boasts cleansing acidity, medium density and a polished finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This pleasant effort is light and cherry-flavored. It shows little evidence of any barrel flavors despite aging in 100% French oak. The tannins stiffen up and give it a bit of backbone. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this shows a pristine, polished bouquet that's composed of black fruit, rum cake, licorice, tobacco and spice. The ripe fruit and cassis notes on the finish add softness and heft. This is elegant and complex, especially in the mouth. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This wine comes from Gascony, where the Gascon and his famous beret are inseparable. This blend of mainly Gros Manseng has some herbal character but it also has yellow fruits, and a ripe edge of honey that softens and fills out the crisp green-fruit flavors. Drink now. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Ripe pink grapefruit flavors dominate this delicious wine. It has minerality as well as some richness, crispened by taut tannins and a citrus aftertaste. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"More familiar and less unusual than prior vintages. This wine deals typical, upright lemon, lime and tropical fruit aromas backed by green apple and lemon-based flavors. With good acidity and an even keel, it is a solid, fresh, dry Albariño that should not disappoint. Imported by Grapes of Spain. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"The region of Lazio in central Italy is not well-known for its wines, but this well-priced 50-50 blend of Montepulciano and Merlot shows its enological potential. This is a rich and penetrating wine with loads of black fruit and spice. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Starts off with oaky, jammy aromas of cherries and raspberries, and tastes a little sweet in fruit pastry, with the baked crust. Seems a little one-dimensional, although that dimension is a very delicious one. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Muruve is a label worth watching in Toro. The wines are not as brawny and robust as some, and instead they offer more reserved pleasures. This reserva shows coconut and black plum aromas, with very ripe but structured black fruit flavors. Coffee and vanilla flood the finish, and overall the wine is raring to go now and over the next few years. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Of all the 2012 releases from Mannina, this is the most dense, dark and substantial. Cassis and black cherry fruit is set against a stiff streak of char and coffee, backed with firm, ripe tannins. The length and balance are just right for ripe fruit from young vines. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"While light-bodied, gentle and intricate, this wine offers plenty of flavor nuances. Cranberry and herb tea aromas mark the nose, while the mouthfeel is at once soothing and tangy, with mulled cherry and clove aromas that slowly emerge and persist on the finish. It's a treat to sip and savor. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in. In the mouth, it's an intense ride of rich black cherry and plum. For now it's a little closed on the finish; will likely be better in three years. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Light-bodied and lacking in tannin, this is a more traditional Barbera, with attractive mixed berry fruit on the nose, followed by forest floor and graham cracker flavors in the mouth. Drink now. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Good price for a rich, textured Syrah. Shows delicious cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, anise, pepper and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Drink this soft, fruity Syrah now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A soft, fat, caramel-flavored wine, showing strawberry fruits and a creamy texture. It lacks acidity, leaving a wine that needs to be drunk soon. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"For fans of grassy, gooseberry-accented wines. Lemon and lime show here, too, with decent acidity. Tiny amounts of Semillon and Chardonnay add dimension. It's fruity and simple, very clean (as you'd expect), a touch sweet and finishes swiftly. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The complexities of Burgundy! This is the vineyard next to the more familiar Les Charmes, just up the slope—hence dessus, meaning above. This vineyard gives a mineral character, hinting at Chablis, but with some Meursault richness as well. Hold this wine, with its delicious vanilla flavors, and it will be ready in a year. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Porty and dull. Almost undrinkable, except for some decent berry and currant flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very dry and fairly tannic, it's severe on first sip and hard to appreciate, although there are some good black cherry, cola, leather, oak and black pepper flavors. It's complex in its own way, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Give it a good, long decanting, and drink it now through 2018. The blend is Mourvèdre, Grenache, Syrah and Counoise, in that order. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"A wonderfully dry, minerally Sauvignon Blanc. It's set off by crisp acidity, and has rewarding flavors of lemons, grapefruits and limes, enriched with pineapples, figs and honeysuckle. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Kind of tough in the mouth at this time, with aggressive tannins that effectively bury the blackberry flavors. There's also a streak of hung meat or smoky leather that adds dimension. Best to let it soften for a few years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smooth and ripe smelling, with clean berry aromas. Cherry, plum and pepper are the lead flavors, and the feel is tangy, zippy and clampy, but exceedingly fresh. Not a lot of richness, depth or body here, but it's pure, clean wine with common appeal. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Simple cherry fruit, with a delicately earthy base, defines this everyday Merlot. It keeps its herbal component in check, balanced appropriately against rather light fruit. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Date and tar notes come nuanced with a funky, sweat-like aroma. The palate feels lax on attack, and it tastes a bit thin on flavor. Firm, upper-lip-grabbing tannins mark the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"It's certainly tannic and tough at the moment, the wine also has so much fruit. That will allow it to round out, bringing out the black currant fruitiness and resulting in a full, rich and perfumed wine. Wait until 2018. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Huge flavors of jammy blackberries and cherries dominate this Syrah, with a coating of sweet, caramelized oak. It's yummy, but not especially complex. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Lightweight and thin in the mouth, this zesty white wine does a good job of keeping your palate refreshed and quenches your thirst (think hot summer day). It's an easy and informal wine that stays focused on simplicity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The nose of this blend of 58% Syrah, 17% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot, 8% Malbec and 8% Petite Sirah is a touch funky, with sour blackberry, charcoal and dried meat aromas. Charred blueberry, sour black plum and savory meat flavors show on the palate. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aromas of vanilla and wood spice lead to elegant, somewhat dried out and dilute fruit flavors, followed by a short finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a Pinot Noir-based blend, and it's quite a good dry, red wine of some sophistication and elegance. Soft and approachable, its cherry fruit flavors are complexed with herbs, such as sage and thyme, and a rich earthiness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Catches your eye with its brassy hue, and also makes its mark with an overtly sweet nose of peach blossom and melon. In the mouth, however, it struggles a bit, offering cider and melon flavors on a soft, rather punchless palate. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Very, very sweet in residual sugar, with powerful flavors of apricots, honey, oranges and vanilla. A bit soft, but the luscious sweetness is what makes it work. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Ame means the spirit, the soul, and Alain Rotier believes this wine expresses the true nature of his Gaillac estate. On that basis, it's a place of great perfumes, coming through in the wine from wood as well as chunky black fruits. It is a relatively soft wine, the concentration in the dense fruit rather than the tannins. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Nice, rugged mountain Zin, with the briary, brambly tannins and peppery taste of wild berries freshly picked off the vine. Alcohol adds heat and structure, and time in the barrel has softened the tannins. This might just be the perfect backyard barbecue red wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A touch of oak influence lends smokiness to the lime, Meyer lemon and tropical fruit flavors. With its crisp acidity that creates a sweet-and-sour taste, this wine is for drinking now as a cocktail sipper or with ham or Chinese food. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A sub-brand of Riunite, Albinea Canali's Ottocentonero shows simple, easy lines with raw fruit, cherry and almond paste. It's a dry Lambrusco without some of the bitterness you sometimes encounter with these wines. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Sangiovese with 25% Merlot for added softness and dimension, this wine boasts pretty notes of cherry, blue flowers, toasted almonds and exotic spice. It has nice elegance overall but is a bit compact in the mouth. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Winemaker Denis Malbec has created a brilliantly delicious, crisp, dry yet richly textured version of the variety that opens with golden honey, dried apricot and lychee on the nose and mouth. Very minerally, the wine has a steely finish with smoky, oaky edges. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Curiously perfumed with notes of roasted hazelnuts and fresh apples, this is a savory, dry Chardonnay. Full bodied in style with notes of nut oil and nut skins throughout, it ends with a hint of wood sap astringency on the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Epineuil is a region between Burgundy and Chablis, producing light, fruity Pinot Noir. This perfumed and dusty wine does show some firm tannins. It is bright with red currant and raspberry fruits, with a fresh aftertaste. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This 12-year old shows signs of maturity, but retains freshness and liveliness as well. With its yeasty edge, toasty flavors and wonderful white fruits all in balance, it is finely balanced. The acidity is kept in check by the richness of the mature fruit. A very complete Champagne. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"You sure can taste the sunny, fruity extract in this wine. It's massive in black cherry liqueur, cassis and mocha-choca flavors. It's also very soft, with a long, almost sweet finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"and sweet, with candied cherry, raspberry and carob flavors. Tasty enough, but seriously lacks the acidity to make this fruity wine come alive. From Cartlidge & Browne. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Just like the '07, this is a blend of 60% Grenache Bl;anc, 20% Marsanne and 20% Roussanne, featuring ripe melon and peach fruit wrapped around an underlying minerality. It's full and broad, yet manages to be refreshing despite its weightiness. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"An intensely mineral expression of Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, full of citrus flavors, deliciously fresh, but also complex. The wine is concentrated into a steel spring of ripeness, ready to burst from the glass. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"This is grandiose, with ripe apricot and peach flavors—even a note of mango—that are allied to the wood notes. As a contrast, there is fine acidity and elegance, with a lemon zest edge that gives structure to this full, superripe, powerful effort. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Light strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry fruit, medium weight, straight-ahead, nicely ripened. The tannins are soft and the balance works just fine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The year 2007 is not going to go down in the books as a good one for Ribera del Duero. Many of the young wines, like this one, are showing narrow, sour fruit and too much funk and pickle. Here, there's a touch of jamminess and red fruit but mostly it's another thin, pushy wine with anemic flavors and a rough mouthfeel. Stick with the 2006 if you can find it. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Lean, sharp and herbal, this is a true apéritif wine that whets the appetite. A slight sour-cream note on the palate is offset by a tangy citrus-laden finish that blends in some cinnamon-spiced pear flavors. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Quite tart when it hits the lips, this is nonetheless a dense, flavorful Pinot Gris, tasting of grapefruit, sour orange, apple and green banana. It shows lots of juice and powers through the mid-palate into a fruit-driven finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A berry scented wine that's loaded with fresh mint aromas and accented by toasty oak.  The tannins are ripe and soft; the acidity bright. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"The '04 was so much better, maybe because of vintage or sourcing differences. This is sharp in green, minty tastes, and the cherry and cola flavors finish simple and thin. Earns an extra point for a rich spiciness. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine is very extracted and jammy, in the modern style of extreme ripeness and fruit-forwardness. Sweet oak, 70% of it new, adds layers of cream, vanilla and buttered toast. Appeals now for its juicy, New World style. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Made in a softly appealing style, this Pinot is like cherry pie sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. It shows Pinot Noir's silky texture. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Pungent and grapey, with notes of violets and dusty chocolate. The astringent fruit shows varietal cassis flavor, somewhat overtaken by the extremely charred, coffee ground flavors of the finish. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This Pinot opens with aromas of strawberry, cherry and flowers, leading into juicy berry flavors and a touch of balsamic, pepper and strawberry. Good structure and a lingering finish give it added appeal. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From down in Paso comes this soft, chocolaty Merlot. Acidity is deficient, but this kind of flavor goes a long way to saving the wine, which has the taste of perfectly ripe, crushed blackberries. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"There is a rosé here struggling to get out. This wine has strawberry fruits combined with tannins in a way that does not work. Bordeaux Clairet lies between rosé and red in color and in taste. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Tart acidity marks this dry wine, interfering with the palate pleasure and causing some imbalance. Otherwise, it shows a tension of cool-climate raspberry and cherry ripeness with a touch of wintergreen mint. Give it more richness, and it's a great wine. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g\/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Layered botrytis that gives the wine both its richness and dense texture. It is sweet but with a dry core and crisp acidity, it will age well. It is going to be a beautiful wine, with tropical fruits, apricots and wonderful final acidity. Drink from 2025. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"Lush, thick and chewy, with rich purple and black fruits, pepper and a finish of vanilla cream. The tannins are substantial but not intrusive; they carry a sensation of rock and graphite. Flavors extend themselves gracefully; the ripe fruit remains front and center, but it finishes with plenty of nuanced rock and spice and hints of herb. An exceptional effort. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A very nice buy at this price. Dry and jammy, the wine features ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, anise, cocoa and mint, with smoky, oaky notes and mouthwateringly crisp coastal acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Immediately appealing for its lush, direct flavors of blackberry pie filling, cherry jam, licorice and cedar flavors, with a vein of dried herbs. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very ripe, almost raisiny, with a cooked fruit flavor, although the wine is fully dry. The tannins are on the harsh side, and the stewed character seems to accentuate the acidity. Drink now. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A blend of Viognier (60%), Roussanne (25%) and Marsanne, this wine is moderately aromatic with notes of pear, melon, apricot and flowers. It's medium bodied with abundant stone fruit flavors, quite reserved considering the warmth of the vintage. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here's a fresh and bright rosé from Central Italy with a delicate bouquet of wild flowers and forest berry. The wine is luminous, pristine and would pair with appetizers or light summer pasta or chicken curry salad. In the mouth, the wine tastes fresh, crisp and clean. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A bit tough and sharp, but not a bad Cabernet. It has deep flavors of blackberries, currants, cola, anise and cedar, and is bone dry. You can bet there's some declassified high-end wine in this blend. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Bright, brambly berry and forest floor notes open this bouquet of this 80-20 Nergroamaro and Malvasia Nera blend. Touches of cherry and sun-ripened prune also make an appearance, especially on the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A delicious Talley Rincon, showing the class of this vineyard. Maybe not the best vintage, lacking some elegance, but the wine is ultrarich and full-bodied, with massive raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink soon. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Tons of flavor in this ripe, juicy wine, which comes from Napa, Monterey and Lodi, an interesting combination of cool and warm climates. Bursting with cherries, blackberries, red licorice, cola, cocoa, dates and vanilla spice, the wine also is balanced. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Terre di Giumara is a line of value wines. This Nero d'Avola offers bright aromas of berry, cassis, fennel, moist earth and almond that recall the natural fragrances of Sicily. The wine is simple, fresh and clean on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The great sweetness of this wine makes its success. It's just delicious, offering up a mouthful of chocolate-covered cherry candy flavors with the sharpness of cassis. Crisp acidity and fine, dusty tannins make it elegant. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a curious, soapy wine with considerable bitterness. There is a toasty edge that shows some bottle maturity, and contrasts with the tense, tight acidity. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A second label for Velocity Cellars. A light wine, with modest characteristics. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a delicate and feminine rosé sparkler that opens with a beautifully pale pink color and subtle aromas of wild berry, tangerine skin, white almond and passion fruit. It shows elegance on the palate, with fine perlage and tangy crispness. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Lots of delicious raspberry and cherry flavors in this spicy wine, but it's just too sweet. That's probably a combination of residual sugar and extraordinarily high alcohol of 16.5%, which makes it almost Port-like. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Aurelio Settimo's lively Dolcetto offers a surprise twist in the form of black fruit, Indian spice and natural rubber. The overall effect is rich in cherry and sweet fruit and the wine tastes plush and creamy on the close. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Pretty dark and full-bodied for a rosé, and too extracted and heavy in cherry-berry flavors to be considered elegant. It's almost a red wine you could drink at room temperature. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This tight, taut and crisp wine needs some time to bring out its true fruity character. Behind the texture, ripe green plums and fresh apples are cut with lime juice. The wine is still young and could benefit from a few more months. Drink from late 2015. ->","completion":" france"}
{"prompt":"A massive wine that could only have been grown under the California sun. Shows enormously ripe flavors of red and black currants, cola, red plums and spices, enriched with significant oak. Not particularly nuanced or elegant now due to the obvious power. Could age out, but the future is uncertain. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Rounded aromas of melon and salty peaches rise to the nose on this wine from the Monterey County appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate is driven by citrus, grass and a rather extreme sense of sea salt, enhanced with mouth-watering acidity and a nectarine flesh finish. It's tasty though varietally uncommon. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A soft, medicinal and uninteresting wine, marked by harshness and green flavors that barely suggest cherries. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is sort of a second wine from Reverie. It's rustic and sharp, with tart, jellied blackberry and cherry flavors. Not going anywhere. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Soft and semisweet, with the honeyed, lemon-and-lime Gatorade taste, this everyday white is simple and clean. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A sophisticated blend of Merlot, Cabernet and Sangioveto from the newly inaugurated Frassinello winery designed by architect Renzo Piano. It has deeply etched oak tones over blueberry and forest berry. The close is fresh and crisp with very good length. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Ripassá is a wine that has been refermented on the skins to produce extra richness and intensity of aromas. This distinctive wine offers tones of blackberry jam, currant, clove and curry powder. It's a luscious and slightly sweet tasting wine with chewy tannins. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Very ripe and aromatic, throwing out cascades of inviting scents. New toasty oak dominates, with undercurrents of blackberry jam, blueberry, mocha and anise. In the mouth, huge, lush, powerful, an explosively fruity young wine, yet maintains balance and elegance. Really good. Best now–2015. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Showing the rich, exotic side of Viognier, this has ripe, flamboyant flavors of tropical fruit, white flower and spice. It has a controlled dryness and citrusy acidity; this is a lovely, versatile white. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Young and appealing now for its vibrant, upfront cherry and oak flavors, this supple Cab has a lush, fine array of dusty tannins, as well as fine acidity. It's beautifully balanced, a tremendously fruity wine that's has a classic structure and elegance. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Here you have more of the stiffer qualities of herb, leaf, earth and stem. Good concentration and length, with a full midpalate. The blend includes 8% Cabernet Franc. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This creamy Tuscan Chardonnay shares many characteristics with its distant cousin in California. It shows a decidedly New World style, with aromas of vanilla cream, dried apricot, honey, peach cobbler and crème brûlée. The finish is marked with a spicy toasted-oak intensity. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Though labeled Cabernet, it's a full-on, four-grape Bordeaux-style blend. It sports a classic Cabernet nose, dusty, smoky, with cherry tobacco, forest floor and a whiff of barnyard. The fruit remains tart and showing a fair amount of acidity; the tannins stiff and the mouthfeel tight but sensual. Give this one until 2017 to pull itself together. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Dark berry, tilled earth and gamey aromas lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers black cherry, chocolate, peppermint and oak alongside tightly packed tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2018. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Young, tart and compact, this is still in the primary fruit phase of its development. Clean, impactful and nicely structured, its flavors run from cranberry to raspberry to light cherry, all running deep enough to suggest tucking it away in the cellar for a few more years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"A lovely, complex and flavorful Cab, but also tannic, giving it a lockdown feeling. There's a rich core of blackberries, black currants, spices and herbs, while new oak gives it a savory smokiness. Better after 2010, and should glide through 2014. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Huge, ripe flavors of blackberry and plum jam, mocha, black currants, anise and cedar mark this wine, grown in the rugged hills of southern Monterey County. It's quite tannic and dry, but doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Barriano is a rosemary green and slightly vegetal blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that is balanced out by a good dose of plump red cherry in the mouth. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"From the winery formerly known as Napa Ridge comes this modestly priced Cab. It's nicely ripe in all kinds of luscious blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, and although it's from the hot region of Lodi, somehow it manages to have crisp acidity. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Smoky and meaty smelling to begin with, like a mix of barbecued spare ribs and roasted berries. The palate is full, tannic and drying, with bacon, hickory and baked blackberry flavors mixed with herbs. Hard and clacky on the finish, but flavorful and solid throughout. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Jammy berry aromas are fiery and aggressive. In the mouth, this is sticky in feel, with huge, grabbing tannins and blocky ripeness. Chocolate and vanilla drape overripe black-fruit flavors, while the finish is heavy, chewy and tastes like fudge. Drink this forceful, oaky RDD now through 2020. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Here's a floral and delicate Cartizze with musky notes and a pretty embroidery of fruit salad. There are delicate mineral nuances that give it linearity and the pulpy fruit gives it texture and persistence. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is made from fruit that's sourced mostly from Mercer's Spice Cabinet Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, with some Tablas clone Syrah from the Rattlesnake Hills. It's a tasty wine but it seems incomplete. It has a ripe purple-fruit flavor, and it comes with plenty of power, but there's a hole in the middle. The finish kicks in with a splash of molasses. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Very compact and clean in its aromatic delivery with banana, Golden Delicious apple and attractive hints of toasted almond in the background. Creamy, smooth and supple in the mouth with a touch of zesty spice on the finish. Imported by Prestige Wine Imports Corp. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Tarry, stalky aromas fail to make much of a statement. This is high in acid and rugged in the mouth, with a mixture of herbal red-fruit flavors and distinct stalkiness. A grating finish is racy and hot. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"The winery's selection of its best barrels makes a fascinating wine, showing mixed Asian spices, supple fruit and beautiful fine-grained tannins. Muscular and detailed, it has a bit of an alcoholic kick to the finish. Powerful and very well-crafted. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This wine shows the potential and power of Valdeorras Godello, but at a fair price. It has a lot of minerality and acidity, but also a boatload of kiwi, green apple, papaya and white pepper. Unconventional for Spanish white wines and very much worth a look. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Benito Ferrara delivers a very nice Fiano di Avellino that lives up to the excellent reputation of the wine thanks to its precise mineral tones and background notes of stone fruit and honeysuckle. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Super dusty, leathery and big shouldered, this is also quite bright and drinkable. Made using grapes sourced from old vines planted within the Esola Vineyard. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Slightly fizzy at first, but honey and almond jump out from the start as the wine finishes light and dry. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Simple and harsh in texture, with wild berry, cola and pepper flavors wrapped into hard, green tannins that make the aftertaste bitter. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"This is a big, brawny, plush, “international” Amarone that sees 4 years of oak and delivers thick layers of espresso coffee, chocolate fudge, wood toast and honey nut. It has a chewy-viscous mouthfeel, rounded off by caressing spice flavors and very good length on the finish. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage. Blackberry and black cherry fruit, adorned with a sprinkling of Sumatra coffee beans, rocks on with polished tannins. The pleasing roasted character is just right to power it through a clean, sexy finish. Drink now and on through 2026. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fragrant and spicy, this savory wine delivers aromas of ripe black cherry, blackberry and white pepper that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity while soft, polished tannins give a smooth, easy-drinking texture. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"A distinctive offering marked by a beautiful seamless quality, some exotic aromatic notes and a unique bottle design. Cedar, sandalwood and a sweet dustiness on the nose open to a cherry and toasty oak palate. Dry and even in the mouth. The finish has fine-grained tannins and a lovely back-end bouquet. Drink now through 2007. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Here's a wine that holds its own in a ranking of top Nebbiolos. There's depth and great promise of fruit here, which is wrapped within folds of vanilla, ginger, cinnamon and dusty mineral. The mouthfeel is plush and velvety and the wine ends with tart but succulent tannins. It will drink beautifully for five-plus years. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"Already past its prime, this Garnacha-based rosado has sweet nectarine aromas along with a sugary, creamy palate. If it had more zest upon release, that's mostly gone at this stage. Wait for the 2006. ->","completion":" spain"}
{"prompt":"Showing lots more depth and focus than Husch's regular Pinot Noir, this wine comes from nearly 40-year-old grapes grown on the estate. It's charming, light and silky in the mouth, with brilliant acidity framing intense flavors of cherries and spices. Should age well for up to a decade. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Heavy on the oak, with overpowering buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. Underneath all that are pineapple and peach flavors. The finish is sweet and heavy. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Bright, round and delicious, this has exotic fruit, white flower and cantaloupe aromas that follow through to the lively palate, along with honeydew melon fruit. It has noteworthy freshness for the vintage. ->","completion":" italy"}
{"prompt":"This vintage marks a big step forward for this Oregon Sauvignon Blanc. As fresh and racy as a bright young Quincy from the Loire, this sappy Sauvignon has the snap of natural acidity and a tongue-tingling mix of melon, lime and grapefruit on the palate. It's drinking beautifully right now while at its most fresh. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Fans of Petit Verdot, which has almost attained cult status in Washington, will not want to miss this spectacular effort. Bright, chewy and muscular though it is, the tannins have been polished perfectly, and set off with 40% new oak, adding dark, smoky chocolate and espresso flavors. The acidity keeps up, underscoring tart berry fruit with some sweet green-tomato highlights. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"An extraordinary wine, dry, crisp in acidity and wonderfully silky in the mouth. The flavors are deep and complex, changing with every second as the wine breathes. Raspberries, wild clove and cinnamon spices, cola, dried herbs, things that taste earthy and minerally and woodsy. Insanely complex and dynamic, this Pinot should age for up to eight years. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"With an off-putting orange color, this Rhône-style blend seems sweet, with orange, apricot and vanilla flavors. ->","completion":" us"}
{"prompt":"Quite green and also raisiny, which doesn't really compute seeing that one indicates underripeness and the other overripeness. But throw both together and you get a wine that's not all that pleasing and seems to be striving for equilibrium. Gummy, green and thick-tasting in the mouth. A hard wine to get excited about. ->","completion":" spain"}
